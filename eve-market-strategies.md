# Preface

EVE Online is unique among online games in that the in-game market has significant importance to players, regardless of the game play style they choose to pursue. Whether in high, low or null security, many \(probably all\) players rely on EVE’s markets to buy and equip ships, sell acquired or produced goods, buy supplies needed for various endeavors, and otherwise fill gaps in the set of things needed to pursue various play styles.

As the market has long been an important feature of EVE, some players have similarly focused on developing tools and strategies to support the use of markets. In the early days, these tools were intended to supplement standard play styles, for example making it easier to track market participation \(e.g. positions, open orders\) as part of a larger strategy \(e.g. mining, production, conquest\). However, as the game has grown, so has the sophistication of the markets, and in modern EVE “playing the markets” is a valid play style pursued by many players.  Third party tool developers have adopted to these changes as well, with many new tools written explicitly to support profiting from the market.  CCP, for their part, has responded by providing more real-time data \(e.g. five minute market snapshots\), and more visibility into alternative markets \(e.g. citadel markets\). The combination of new tools and rich data has made it possible to implement many “real life” trading strategies that were previously difficult to execute[^1].

This book attempts to be a systematic discussion of data driven analysis and trading strategies in EVE's markets.  The strategies we derive here rely on public data provided by CCP.  Not all of this data is market data and, in fact, more complicated strategies often rely on non-market data. Regardless, all of this data is publicly available: the strategies we describe here don’t rely on non-public or otherwise proprietary data.  We derive concepts and strategies using publicly available tools, and we share our techniques through a number of examples \(including source code\).  While the example code we present here is suitable for illustrative purposes, serious market players will likely want to write custom, optimized code for certain strategies \(as the author does\).

## Summary of Chapters

The remainder of the book is organized as follows:

* [Chapter 1 - Preliminaries](#preliminaries)
  This chapters describes key features of the EVE markets and introduces tools and data sources used to describe trading strategies.  This chapter concludes with several examples introducing the tools.
* [Chapter 2 - Arbitrage](#arbitrage)
  This chapter describes arbitrage trading which is the process of discovering undervalued market items which can be purchased and turned into profit very quickly.
* [Chapter 3 - Market Making](#market-making)
  This chapter describes market making strategies, better known as station trading, which profits from market participants willing to "cross the spread" instead of waiting for better prices through limit orders.

## Change Log

* 2017-02-12: Beyond the initial three chapters, we have three additional chapters planned:
  * "Simulating Trading Strategies" - eventually this will describe a simple back test simulator we're developing.
  * "Risk" - this chapter will give a more careful treatment to risk around trading \(and EVE in general\).
  * "Trend Trading" - this chapter will discuss trend-based trading strategies.

[^1]: I'm not claiming CCP intended to enable specific trading strategies, only that the data available now makes this possible.

# Preliminaries

This chapter explains the mechanics of EVE markets and introduces the various sources of market data we use to develop trading strategies.  We also introduce the tools we'll use in the rest of the book to develop our strategies.  We end the chapter with several examples illustrating these tools.

## Market Structure

EVE markets are governed by a set of rules which define how orders are placed, how they are matched, and what charges are imposed on the participants in a trade.  Market structure in EVE is somewhat unique, but if comparisons to actual financial markets must be made, then EVE markets are most similar to a commodities spot market.  Commodities markets trade physical assets \(or rather, the right of ownership of assets\), much the same as trading occurs in EVE markets.  A "spot market" is a market in which assets are exchanged at current prices, as opposed to prices guaranteed by a contract \(e.g. futures markets\).

Many good descriptions of EVE markets are already available on the web.  We recommend reading EVE University's [Trading Introduction](http://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Trading) for a thorough overview of the interface, important skills and basic mechanics.  Rather than recount that description here, we instead provide a more academic treatment of some key aspects of EVE markets below.

### Order Mechanics

There are two order types in EVE markets:

* A *market order* is an instruction to buy or sell an asset at the current best available price.
* A *limit order* is an instruction to buy or sell an asset at a fixed price, which may be different than the current best available price.

Although this terminology is standard in financial literature, the EVE UI does not use these terms in order placement screens.  Generally speaking, if you are placing an order using the "advanced" UI screen \(with a duration other than "immediate"\), then you are placing a limit order.  Otherwise, you are placing a market order.  This is true even if your limit order is matched immediately, and has important consequences in terms of trading cost \(see below\).

Orders are handled "First In, First Out" \(FIFO\), meaning the sequence of order arrival determines priority for matching with other orders.  When a sell order is placed, the items being sold are placed in escrow at the seller's location.  If a sell order is filled, then the sold items are moved to the buyer's hangar at the seller's location.  In other words, all transactions occur at the seller's location.  This has at least two important consequences for trading strategies:

1. If the buyer is not in the same station as the seller, then the buyer may need to transport purchased goods elsewhere; and,
2. If the seller is in a player-owned structure which is not accessible to the buyer \(e.g. access controls are changed after the sale\), then the buyer's assets may become stranded.

Market participation from player-owned structures is a relatively recent feature \(at time of writing\).  However, the number of such participants is growing, making it important to consider access risk when buying goods from sellers in these structures.[^2]

### Price Formation

Trade prices in EVE markets are determined by order matching rules.  Unlike other financial markets, there is no facility for price negotiation or auction, although some of these features exist in secondary markets \(e.g. the contract system\).  Sell orders in EVE have a location, price, quantity and minimum volume.  Buy orders have a location, price, quantity, minimum volume and range.  A pair of orders match when:

1. The location of the sell order is within range of the location specified in the buy order.
2. The sell order represents the first, lowest priced sell order within range of the buy order.
3. The buy order represents the first, highest priced buy order within range of the sell order.
4. A price exists which meets the pricing constraints \(see below\).

The price at which the transaction occurs must satisfy the following constraints:

1. A sell limit order must match at or above the posted price on the order.
2. A buy limit order must match at or below the posted price on the order.
3. A buy or sell market order must match at the posted price on the order.
4. If the sell order has precedence \(arrived at the market first\), then the transaction price is the maximum price which satisfies the above constraints.
5. If the buy order has precedence, then the transaction price is the minimum price which satisfies the above constraints.

The effect of precedence rules means that some care must be taken when pricing orders.  For example, suppose a sell limit order is placed for 100 ISK.  Suppose further that this order is currently the best available sale price \(i.e. the first, lowest price available in the current location\).  If a buy limit order is then placed for 101 ISK, then this order will match immediately at a price of 101 ISK \(*not* 100 ISK\) because the sell order has precedence.  A similar behavior occurs when buy limit orders have precedence.

### Transaction Costs

EVE markets impose two fees on orders:

* *Broker Fees* are charged at order placement time for all limit orders \(even orders which match immediately\).  The owner of the order is charged this fee.
* *Sales Tax* is charged each time a sell order is matched and is paid by the seller.

Broker fees are charged as a percentage of the total order value, with the charge normally between 2.5% and 5% \(adjusted by standing and the Broker Relations skill\).  Sales tax is charged as a percentage of the matched order volume multiplied by the match price, with the charge normally between 1% and 2% \(adjusted by the Accounting Skill\).  Sales tax in player-owned structures is determined by the owner and may be lower than the normal range.

There are two important consequences of this fee structure:

1. Market buy orders incur no fees.  Thus, it can sometimes be advantageous to simply wait for a good price instead of placing a limit buy order \(which will incur a broker fee\); and,
2. The fees determine the minimum return required for a profitable strategy.  For example, a typical market making strategy which uses limit orders on both the buy and sell side will need to return at least 6% to be profitable \(5% paid on both sides for limit orders, plus 1% sales tax on transactions\).

Training Broker Relations and Accounting skills is usually mandatory for serious EVE market players as these skills at max training reduce fees by a significant amount.

### Information Disclosure

The primary live source of information for EVE markets is the game client UI which shows a live view of the current order book for each asset, as well as historical pricing information.  CCP provides third party developer APIs which expose similar information \(see below\), but the game client is always the most up to date view of the markets.  Several important metrics are visible from the game client including the volume \(total assets traded\) to date, and the current spread \(difference between best buy price and best sell price\) between buyers and sellers.  The order book for a given asset displays price, volume and location for each order, but does *not* display the names of market participants.  However, the names of market participants *are* recorded and visible to each counter-party when a transaction is completed.  This is a unique feature of EVE markets which is quite different from other financial markets where anonymity is preserved between counter-parties.[^3]  This feature also provides an opportunity for traders to gather more information about other market participants, for example by buying or selling in small quantities to competing bids in order to discover the names of competitors.

Recent EVE expansions have added the ability to create market hubs in player-owned structures.  These hubs are added to the market for the region they are located in, allowing orders to be placed from player-owned locations.  Although market hubs are now included in regional markets, the player-owned structure itself may not be publicly accessible, or accessibility may change during the course of a day's market events.  As a result:

* Sell orders may appear from player-owned structures, but sold items may be inaccessible if a structure changes access after the transaction completes; and,
* Buy orders may appear from non-public player-owned structures.  The location of these structures is visible in game, but is currently *not* visible in data out of game \(e.g. third party APIs\).

It is generally safe to sell to orders placed from player-owned structures.  However, great care should be taken when buying from orders placed from player-owned structures.  Missing location information in out of game data sources is mostly an annoyance right now as workarounds exist to obtain the needed information.

### Contract System

EVE has a large secondary market called the "contract system" which allows for direct player to player exchange of numerous assets, including assets which are not tradable on EVE markets \(e.g. fitted ships\).  We don't cover the contract system is this book, mainly because there is currently no reliable third party API to gather information about available contracts.

## Market Data

As noted above, market data is visible in the game client in two separate views:

1. A view of the current order book for an asset in a region; and
2. A view of the daily high, low, and average trade prices \(and related metrics\), and total volume for an asset as far back as one year.

The game client always shows the most recent view of market data.  All other data sources \(e.g. third party developer sources\) lag the game client.  It's also worth noting that the game client is the only EULA-approved way to participate in the market by buying or selling assets.[^4]

Data driven development of trading strategies is usually conducted offline, preferably using several years of market data.  CCP has only recently invested effort in making market data easily accessible to third party developers.  Historically, market data was gathered through crowd sourcing efforts by scraping cached data stored in the game client.[^5]  Scraped data was then aggregated and made available by third party sites like [EVE Central](https://eve-central.com/).  Asset coverage relied on having enough players interested in regularly viewing certain assets \(so that the client cache would be refreshed regularly\).  The fact that players themselves were providing data also raised concerns about purposely modifying data to affect game play.  Despite these limitations and risks, crowd sourced data was the primary source of market data for many years.  

In 2015, CCP started providing market history, order book, and market pricing data through their ["CREST" API](https://eveonline-third-party-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/crest/index.html).  CREST is a REST-based web API which supports both public and authorized data endpoints.  Authorized endpoints use the [EVE Single Sign-On](https://eveonline-third-party-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sso/index.html) service based on OAuth access control.  CREST authorization is only used for certain player or corporation related endpoints.  Market data can be accessed on CREST without authentication.  When market modules were released for player-owned structures \(e.g. Citadels\), public buy orders placed in these modules were eventually made visible in CREST market data.  However, CREST provided no mechanism for resolving the location where these player-owned structures resided, making it difficult to implement the same order matching rules as provided in the game client.

While CREST was an important upgrade for third party developers \(as compared to the [XML API](https://eveonline-third-party-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/xmlapi/index.html)\), CCP significantly modernized third party APIs by releasing the [EVE Swagger Interface \(ESI\)](https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/) which exposed a new REST-based web API documented with [Swagger](http://swagger.io/).  Swagger documentation allows the use of many convenient tools for third party developers, such as API browsers and client generators in a variety of languages.  Swagger also provides clean support for versioning and authorization, making it much easier for CCP to evolve the API over time.  The ESI provides the same market data as in CREST with two important upgrades:

1. A facility for resolving the location of certain player-owned structures; and,
2. Access to order book data local to player-owned structures.

The ESI uses the same OAuth based authorization scheme as CREST.  At time of writing, CCP has declared ESI as the API of the future and has deprecate both CREST and the XML API.  However, CCP has stated they will keep the XML API and CREST active at least until ESI reaches feature parity.  Unless otherwise indicated, examples in this book which require direct access to live market data will use the ESI endpoints.

The remainder of this section describes the main market data ESI endpoints in more detail.  

### Market History Endpoints

The market history endpoint returns a daily price summary for a given asset type in a given region.  In financial modeling terms, this data is similar to daily stock market data.  The market history endpoint returns all data from the start of the previous calendar year.  Note that data for the current day is typically not available until approximately 0800 UTC the following day.

We'll use market history to demonstrate the use of the ESI.  ESI endpoints follow REST conventions and can always be accessed using the HTTP protocol.  For example, the following URL will return market history for Tritanium \(type 34\) in Forge \(region 10000002\):

```
https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/markets/10000002/history/?datasource=tranquility&type_id=34
```

The result of this request will be a JSON formatted array of values of the form:

```json
{
  "date": "2015-05-01",
  "average": 5.25,
  "highest": 5.27,
  "lowest": 5.11,
  "order_count": 2267,
  "volume": 16276782035
}
```

where:

* *date* - gives the date for which the values are reported.
* *average* - gives the average trade price of the asset for the day.
* *highest* - gives the highest trade price of the asset for the day.
* *lowest* - gives the lowest trade price of the asset for the day.
* *order_count* - gives the number of trades for the day.
* *volume* - gives the number of units traded for the day.

What makes the ESI special is the Swagger definition which can be retrieved at:

```
https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/swagger.json?datasource=tranquility
```

The Swagger definition is a structured description of the endpoints of ESI, including the name and type of the arguments required, the format of the result, and any authorization that may be required.  Tools make use of this definition to automatically generate documentation and API clients.  For example, the documentation of the above endpoint can be found [here](https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/#!/Market/get_markets_region_id_history).

In addition to the response body, the ESI also returns several important HTTP response headers.  There are three headers you should observe:

* *date* - this is the date at the server when the result was generated.  All dates are normally UTC \(i.e. "EVE" time\).
* *last-modified* - this is the date the response body was last changed.  The difference between *date* and *last-modified* gives the age of the data.
* *expires* - this is the date when the current response body should be refreshed.  It will be unproductive to request the data again before this time.

The *expires* field is important for automated collection of data, and for competitive analysis.  The tools we describe later in this chapter use *expires* to drive regular downloads of the data for historical analysis.  The *expires* field also tells you how frequently other market participants can see fresh data \(unless they are using the game client\).

### Order Book Data Endpoints

The market order book endpoints return a view of the current orders for a given region, optionally restricted to a given type.  The ESI endpoint to retrieve this data is ["get market region orders"](https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/#!/Market/get_markets_region_id_orders).  The following URL will retrieve the first page of orders for Tritanium \(type 34\) in Forge \(region 10000002\):

```
https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/markets/10000002/orders/?datasource=tranquility&order_type=all&page=1&type_id=34
```

Leaving off `type_id=34` will return all orders for all types in the given region.  The result of this request will be a JSON formatted array of values of the form:

```json
{
  "order_id": 4740968511,
  "type_id": 34,
  "location_id": 60005599,
  "volume_total": 1296000,
  "volume_remain": 952089,
  "min_volume": 1,
  "price": 10,
  "is_buy_order": false,
  "duration": 90,
  "issued": "2017-01-06T22:29:36Z",
  "range": "region"
}
```

where:

* *order_id* - gives the unique order id for this order.
* *type_id* - gives the type of asset transacted by this order.
* *location_id* - gives the location where this order was placed.  The location is important for computing possible order matches and is discussed in more detail below.
* *volume_total* - gives the total number of assets to be transacted when the order was placed.
* *volume_remain* - gives the number of assets still left to be transacted for this order.
* *min_volume* - gives the minimum number of assets which must be exchanged each time this order is matched.  Note that "volume\_remain" can be less than "min\_volume", in which case fewer assets may transact on the last match for the order.
* *price* - is the posted priced for the order.
* *is_buy_order* - is true if the order is a "bid" \(buy\), otherwise the order is an "ask" \(sell\).
* *duration* - is the length of time in days that the order will remain in the book until it is matched.
* *issued* - is the issue date of the order.
* *range* - only applies to bids and is the maximum distance from the origin station that an ask will be allowed to match.

Order book data is the most current out of game view of the markets and is therefore very important data for many traders.  Some important properties about order book data:

* At time of writing, order book data is refreshed every five minutes.  That is, your view of market data may be up to five minutes old.  You can refer to the *expires* response header to determine when the order book will be refreshed.
* Order book data for most active regions can not be returned in a single API call \(unless filtering for a single type\).  Instead, book data is "paged" across multiple calls.  The requested page is controlled by the "page" argument as shown in the URL above.  The ESI does not report how many total pages are available.  The normal solution is to continue to retrieve pages until a page is returned containing less than 10000 orders.  This indicates the last page available for the query.  The "page" argument is ignored for requests filtered by type.
* Order book data may include orders from player-owned structures, some of which may be non-public.  Orders from non-public structures cause problems for out of game analysis because the ESI currently provides no way to discover the location of these structures.  Crowd sourced data can be used in these cases \(see [Example 3 - Trading Rules: Build an Order Matching Algorithm](#example-3---trading-rules-build-an-order-matching-algorithm) below\).

Order book data can also be requested directly from player-owned structures.  This is done using the ["get markets structures"](https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/#!/Market/get_markets_structures_structure_id) endpoint.  Some player-owned markets are not public, despite their buy orders appearing the regional market, but for those that allow access, the format of the results is identical to the format returned by the ["get market region orders"](https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/#!/Market/get_markets_region_id_orders) endpoint.

### Pricing Data Endpoints

Certain industrial calculations, such as reprocessing tax, require reference price data computed by CCP on a daily basis.  This data is available to third party developers using the ["get market prices"](https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/#!/Market/get_markets_prices) endpoint.  A request to this endpoint will return an array of price data in this format:

```json
{
  "type_id": 32772,
  "average_price": 501374.49,
  "adjusted_price": 502330.89
}
```

where:

* *type_id* - gives the asset type.
* *average_price* - gives a rolling average price[^6].
* *adjusted_price* - gives a formulaic price which is used as a reference price in several calculations.  The formula by which this price is computed is not publicly documented.

We document this endpoint because some strategies discussed in later chapters need to compute certain industrial formulas.

### Structure Location Endpoints

The last market data endpoint we document is the ["get universe structure id"](https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/#!/Universe/get_universe_structures_structure_id) endpoint.  This is an authenticated endpoint which provides player-owned structure information in the format:

```json
{
  "name": "V-3YG7 VI - The Capital",
  "solar_system_id": 30000142
}
```

where:

* *name* - gives the name of the player-owned structure.
* *solar_system_id* - gives the solar system where the structure resides.

The use for this endpoint is not obvious until one needs to calculate which orders will match in a given region.  As described above, the buy orders which match a given sell order are determined by the location of the sell order, and the range and location of each buy order.  Therefore, the location of player-owned structures must be known in order to determine whether buy orders submitted at those structures can potentially match.  At time of writing, the structure location endpoint is the only third party API which provides access to the location of public player-owned structures.  However, as we discussed in [Order Book Data Endpoints](#order-book-data-endpoints), the order book for a region may also display buy orders from non-public player-owned structures.  The structure location endpoint can not be used to determine the location of these structures unless the \(authenticated\) caller is authorized to view this data \(for example, the caller is a member of the corporation which owns the player-owned structure\).  Fortunately, there is at least one third party data source that attempts to document the location of non-public structures.  We show an example of using the structure location endpoint, as well as other third party data sources, when we construct an order matching algorithm in [Example 3](#example-3---trading-rules-build-an-order-matching-algorithm) below.  

### Discovering Trade Data

As noted above, CCP currently does not provide an API endpoint for retrieving individual trades.  This lack of data is limiting in some cases, but fortunately a portion of trades can be inferred by observing changes in order book data.  This approach is effective for trades that do not completely consume a standing limit order.  However, limit orders which are removed from the order book can not be distinguished from canceled orders.  Thus, the best we can do is rely on heuristics to attempt to estimate trades we can't otherwise infer.  Because CCP publishes daily trade volume, we do have some measure of how close our heuristics match reality.  We'll derive a simple trade estimation heuristic in [Example 4](#example-4---unpublished-data-build-a-trade-heuristic) below.

## Tools used in this Book

This section provides an introduction to the tools we use to develop strategies in the remainder of the book.  As you may have surmised, access to historic and live market data is critically important for analysis, back test, live testing and execution of trading strategies.  Many third party sites provide this data in various formats.  At Orbital Enterprises, we've created our own market data collection tools which we describe below.  Our tools, as well as most modern tools \(including the EVE Swagger Interface\), use web interfaces annotated with [Swagger](http://swagger.io/).  We therefore provide a brief introduction to Swagger along with a few tips for working with Swagger-annotated endpoints.  The [EVE Static Data Export (SDE)](https://developers.eveonline.com/resource/resources) is another critical resource for third party developers and is needed for some of the strategies we described in this book.  The SDE is provided as a raw data export which most players acquire themselves.  At Orbital Enterprises, we've created an online tool for accessing the SDE which we use in our examples.  We describe this tool below.  Finally, we briefly introduce [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) which has quickly become the de facto data science tool in python.  Most of the examples we provide in the book are shared as Jupyter notebooks on our [GitHub site](https://github.com/OrbitalEnterprises/eve-market-strategies).

### Market Data Tools

Orbital Enterprises hosts a [market collection service](https://evekit.orbital.enterprises//#/md/main) which provides historic and live access to book data and daily market snapshots \(the "Order Book Data" and "Market History" endpoints described above, respectively\).  The service exposes a Swagger annotated API which can be accessed [interactively](https://evekit.orbital.enterprises//#/md/ui).  Historic data is uploaded nightly to [Google Storage](https://storage.googleapis.com/evekit_md) organized by date.  Although the entire history maintained by the site is accessible through the service API, for research and back testing purposes it is usually more convenient to download the data in bulk from the Google Storage site.

> ### About Swagger
>
> [Swagger](http://swagger.io/) is a configuration language for describing REST-based web services.  A Swagger-annotated web site will normally provide a `swagger.json` file which defines the services provided by the site.  For example, CCP's EVE Swagger Interface provides [this `swagger.json` file](https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/swagger.json?datasource=tranquility).
>
> The power of Swagger is that the `swagger.json` file can be provided as input to tools which automate the generation of documentation and client code.  For example, the [Swagger UI](http://petstore.swagger.io/) will generate an interactive UI for any valid Swagger specification.  The [Swagger Editor](http://editor.swagger.io/#/) has similar capabilities but will also generate clients \(and servers\) in a variety of programming languages.  In most cases, you won't ever need to manually inspect a Swagger configuration file \(much less learn the configuration language\) as the tooling does all the hard work for you.
>
> In this book, we introduce many APIs using the Swagger UI.  You can follow along by browsing to the generic [Swagger UI](http://petstore.swagger.io/) and inserting the URL for the appropriate `swagger.json` configuration file.  Most of our code samples are in Python for which we use the [Bravado](https://github.com/Yelp/bravado) Swagger client generator.  We'll describe Bravado in more detail below.
>
> **NOTE:** the generic Swagger UI will *not* work with authorized endpoints of the ESI.  This is because of the way single sign-on is implemented with the ESI servers.  Using authorized endpoints from batch \(i.e. non-interactive\) code is likewise challenging.  One work around is to use a proxy like the [ESI Proxy](https://github.com/OrbitalEnterprises/orbital-esi-proxy) which we use at Orbital Enterprises.  This proxy handles OAuth authorization flows automatically, exposing a much simpler interface to our market strategy code.

Let's use the Swagger UI to introduce the Orbital Enterprises market collection service.  You can follow along by browsing to the [interactive UI](https://evekit.orbital.enterprises//#/md/ui).  The UI lists three endpoints:

![EveKit MarketData Server](img/mcs_view_1.PNG)

These endpoints provide the following functions:

* *history* - retrieves market history by type, region and date.
* *book* - retrieves the order book snapshot by type and region closest to a specified time stamp.
* *livebook* - a specialized version of the *book* endpoint which always retrieves the latest order book snapshot for a region and list of type IDs.

Each endpoint can be expanded to view documentation and call the service.  For example, expanding the *history* endpoint reveals:

![Expanded History Endpoint](img/mcs_view_2.PNG)

Filling in the *typeID*, *regionID* and *date* fields with "34", "10000002" and "2017-01-15" returns the following result \(Click "Try it out!"\):

![Market history for Tritanium (type 34) in The Forge (region 10000002) on 2017-01-15](img/mcs_view_3.PNG)

The fields in the result match the "Market History" ESI endpoint with following additions:

* *typeID* - the type ID of the result.
* *regionID* - the region ID of the result.
* *date* - the retrieval date timestamp in milliseconds UTC since the epoch \(1970-01-01 00:00:00\).

The *book* endpoint has a similar interface but since order book snapshots have five minute resolution \(based on the cache timer for the endpoint\), you can provide a full timestamp.  The endpoint will return the latest book snapshot before the specified date/time.  Here is the result of the same query above at 10:00 \(UTC\):

![Book snapshot for Tritanium (type 34) in the Forge (region 10000002) at 2017-01-15T10:00:00](img/mcs_view_4.PNG)

The result is a JSON object where the *bookTime* field records the snapshot time in milliseconds UTC since the epoch.  The *orders* field list the buy and sell orders in the order book snapshot.  The fields in the order results match the "Order Book Data" ESI endpoint with some slight modifications \(e.g. timestamps are converted to milliseconds UTC since the epoch\) and the addition of *typeID* and *regionID* fields.

The *livebook* endpoint is identical to the *book* endpoint with two main differences:

1. You may specify multiple type IDs \(up to 100 at time of writing\).  The result will contain order books for all the requested types.
2. The result always represents the latest live data.  That is, there is no *date* argument to this endpoint.

The *livebook* endpoint is most useful for live testing or live execution of trading strategies.  We use this endpoint in the later chapters for specific strategies.

As we noted above, the endpoints of the market collection service are most useful for casual testing or for retrieving live data for running strategies.  For back testing, it is usually more convenient to download historic data in bulk to local storage.  The format of historic data is described on the [market collection service site](https://evekit.orbital.enterprises//#/md/main).  We introduce python code to read historic data below, either directly from Google Storage, or from local storage.

### Static Data Export \(SDE\)

The EVE Static Data Export is a regularly released static dump of in-game reference material.  We've already seen data provided by the SDE in the last section - the numeric values for Tritanium (type ID 34) and The Forge (region ID 10000002) were provided by the SDE.  The SDE is released by CCP at the [Developer Resources Site](https://developers.eveonline.com/resource/resources).  The modern version of the SDE consists of [YAML](http://www.yaml.org/) formatted files.  However, most players find it more convenient to access the SDE from a relational database.  Steve Ronuken provides conversions of the raw SDE export to various database formats at his [Fuzzworks site](https://www.fuzzwork.co.uk/dump/).

At Orbital Enterprises, we expose the latest two releases of the SDE as an [online service](https://evekit.orbital.enterprises//#/sde/main).  The underlying data is just Steve Ronuken's MySQL conversion accessed through a Swagger-annotated web service we provide.  If you don't want to download the SDE yourself, you may want to use our online service instead.  Most of the examples we present in this book use the Orbital Enterprises service.

Because our service is Swagger-annotated, there is a ready made [interactive service](https://evekit.orbital.enterprises//#/sde/ui) you can use to access the SDE:

![Orbital Enterprises Online SDE UI](img/sde_view_1.PNG)

The "Release" drop down at the top can be used to select which SDE release to query against \(the default is the latest release\).  At time of writing, we always maintain the two latest releases.  We may consider maintaining more releases in the future.  Queries against the online service use JSON expressions which are explained on the [main site](https://evekit.orbital.enterprises//#/sde/main).  As an example, let's look at a query to determine the type ID for Tritanium.  First expand the "Inventory" section, then select "/inv/type":

![Partial view of the Inventory - Type endpoint](img/sde_view_2.PNG)

We'll search by partial name.  Scroll down until the "typeName" field is visible and replace the default query value with `{ like: '%trit%' }`.  Then click "Try it out!" \(or just hit enter\).  You'll see a result similar to the following:

![SDE query result](img/sde_view_3.PNG)

The result includes all types with names that contain the string "trit" \(case insensitive\).  There are many such types, but the first result in this example happens to be the type we were searching for.  Most of the market strategies we describe in this book rely on data in the "Inventory" and "Map" sections of the SDE.  You can find reasonably recent documentation on the data stored in the SDE at the crowd sources [Third Party Developer](http://eveonline-third-party-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) documentation site.  We provide more explicit documentation in the sections below where we use the SDE.

### Jupyter Notebook

Our method for developing trading strategies could loosely be called "data science", meaning we use scientific methods and tools for extracting knowledge or insight from raw data.  Our main tool is the Python programming language around which a rich set of libraries and methodologies have been developed to support data science.  Strategy development is an iterative process, and during the early stages of development it is useful to have tools which are interactive in nature.  The [Jupyter Project](http://jupyter.org/) and its predecessor [iPython](https://ipython.org/) are arguably the most popular interactive tools for data science with Python[^7].  When combined with [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/) and [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/), the Jupyter platform provides a very capable interactive data science environment.  We use this environment almost exclusively in the examples we describe in this book.  It is not mandatory, but you'll get much more out of this book if you install Jupyter yourself and try out some of our examples.

The easiest way to get started with Jupyter is to install [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) which is available for Windows, Mac and Linux.  Anaconda is a convenient packaging of several open source data science tools for Python (also R and Scala), and also includes Jupyter.  Once you've installed Anaconda, you can get started with Jupyter by following the [quickstart](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/running.html) instructions \(essentially just `jupyter notebook` in a shell and you're ready\).  If you're reasonably familiar with Python you can crash ahead and click "New -> Python 3" from your local Jupyter instance to create your first notebook.  If you'd like a more comprehensive introduction, we like [this tutorial](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/tutorial-jupyter-notebook).

> ### Python 2 or Python 3?
>
> If you're familiar with Python, you'll know that Python 3 is the recommended environment for new code but, unfortunately, Python 3 broke compatibility with Python 2 in many areas.  Moreover, the large quantity of code still written in Python 2 \(at time of writing\) often leaves developers with a difficult decision as to which environment to use.  Fortunately, all of the data science libraries we need for this book have been ported to Python 3.  So we've made the decision to use Python 3 exclusively in this book.  If you *must* use Python 2, you'll find that most of our examples can be back-ported without difficulty.  However, if you don't have a strong reason to use Python 2, we recommend you stick with Python 3.

The main interface to Jupyter is the notebook, which is a language *kernel* combined with code, text, graphs, etc.  A language kernel is a back end capable of executing code in a given language.  All of the examples we present in this section use the Python 3 language kernel, but Jupyter allows you to install other kernels as well \(e.g. Python 2, R, Scala, Java, etc.\).  The code within a notebook is executed by the kernel with output displayed in the notebook.  Text, graphic and other non-code artifacts are handled by the Jupyter environment itself and provide a way to document your work, or develop instructional material \(as we're doing in this book\).  Notebooks naturally keep a history of your actions \(numbered code or text sections\) and allow you to edit and re-run previous bits of code.  That is, to iterate on your experiments.  Finally, notebooks automatically checkpoint \(i.e. regularly save your progress\) and can be saved and restored at a later time.  Make sure you run your notebook on a reasonably powerful machine, however, as deeper data analysis will use up significant memory.

The environment installed from Anaconda has most of the code we'll need, but from time to time you may need to install other code.  In this book, we do this in two cases:

1. We'll install a few libraries that typically aren't included in Anaconda.  In fact, we'll do this almost immediately in the first example below so that we can use the [Bravado](https://github.com/Yelp/bravado) library for interacting with Swagger-annotated web services.

2. As we work through the examples, we'll begin to develop a set of useful libraries we'll want to use in later examples.  We *could* copy this code to each of our notebooks but that would start to clutter our examples.  Instead, we'll show you how to install these libraries in the default path used by the Jupyter kernel.

We'll provide instructions for installing missing libraries in the examples where they are needed.  Including your own code into Jupyter is a matter of ensuring the path to your packages is included in the "python path" used by Jupyter.  If you're already familiar with Python, you're free to choose your favorite way of adding your local path.  If you're less familiar with Python, we suggest adding your packages to your local `.ipython` folder which is created the first time you start a Python kernel in Jupyter.  This directory will be created in the home directory of the user which started the kernel.

> ### Python Virtual Environments
>
> Notebooks provide a basic level of code isolation, but all notebooks share the set of packages installed in the Python kernel \(as well as any default modifications made to the Python path\).  This means that any new packages you install \(such as those we provide instructions for in some of the examples\) will affect all notebooks.  This can cause version problems when two different notebooks rely on two different versions of the same package.  For this reason, Python professionals try to avoid installing project specific packages in the "global" Python kernel.  Instead, the pros create one or more "virtual environments" which isolate the customization needed for specific work.  This lets you divide your experiments so that work in one experiment doesn't accidentally break the work you've already done in another experiment.
>
> Virtual environments are an advanced topic which we won't try to cover here.  Interested parties should check out the [virtualenv](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv) package or read up on using [Conda](https://conda.io/docs/) to set up isolated development environments.  In our experience, it is easier to use `conda` to create separate Jupyter environments, but instructions exist for using `virtualenv` to do this as well.  We document our Conda setup at the end of this chapter for the curious.

## Example Analysis and Calculations

We finish this chapter with code examples illustrating basic analysis techniques we use in the remainder of the book.  If you'd like to follow along, you'll need to install Jupyter as described in the previous section.  As always, you can find our code as well as Jupyter notebooks in the `code` directory in our [GitHub project](https://github.com/OrbitalEnterprises/eve-market-strategies).

### Example 1 - Data Extraction: Make a Graph of Market History

In this example, we're going to create a simple graph of market history \(i.e. daily price snapshots\) for a year of data.  We've arbitrarily chosen to graph Tritanium in Forge.  When we're done, we'll have a graph like the following:

![Tritanium price over a year in The Forge](img/ex1_graph.png)

We'll use this simple example to introduce basic operations we'll use throughout this book.  If you want to follow along, you can download the [Jupyter notebook](code/book/Example_1_Data_Extraction.ipynb) for this example.  Since this is our first example, we'll be extra verbose in our explanation.

We'll create our graph in four steps:

1. We'll use the Static Data Export \(SDE\) to look up type and region ID, respectively, for "Tritanium" and "The Forge".
2. Next, we'll construct a date range for a year of data from the current date.
3. Then, we'll use the market data service to download daily market snapshots for our date range, and store the data in a Pandas [DataFrame](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/dsintro.html#dataframe).
4. Finally, we'll plot average price from the DataFrame.

We'll expand on a few variants of these steps at the end of the example to set up for later examples.  But before we can do any of this, we need to install [Bravado](https://github.com/Yelp/bravado) in order to access Swagger-annotated web services.  You can install bravado as follows \(do this before you start Jupyter\):

```bash
$ pip install bravado
```

> ### Installing Bravado on Windows
>
> On Windows, you may see an error message about missing C++ tools when building the "twisted" library.  You can get these tools for free from Microsoft at [this link](http://landinghub.visualstudio.com/visual-cpp-build-tools).  Once these tools are installed, you should be able to complete the install of bravado.

Once you've installed Bravado, you can start Jupyter and create a Python 3 notebook.  Almost every notebook we create will start with an import preamble that brings in a few key packages.  So we'll start with this Jupyter cell:

![Import Preamble](img/ex1_cell1.PNG)

The first thing we need to do is use the SDE to lookup the type and region ID, respectively, for "Tritanium" and "The Forge".  Yes we already know what these are from memory; we'll write the code anyway to demonstrate the process.  The next two cells import Swagger and create a client which will connect to the online SDE hosted by Orbital Enterprises:

![Create a Swagger client for the online SDE](img/ex1_cell2.PNG)

The `config` argument to the Swagger client turns off response validation and instructs the client to return raw Python objects instead of wrapping results in typed Python classes.  We turn off response validation because some Swagger endpoints return slightly sloppy but otherwise usable responses.  We find working with raw Python objects to be easier than using typed classes, but this is a matter of personal preference.  We're now ready to look up type ID which is done in the following cell:

![Call and result of looking up "Tritanium"](img/ex1_cell3.PNG)

We use the `getTypes` method on the `Inventory` endpoint, selecting on the `typeName` field \(using the syntax described [here](https://evekit.orbital.enterprises//#/sde/main)\).  The result is an array of all matches to our query.  In this case, there is only one type called "Tritanium" which is the first element of the result array.

> ### Pro Tip: Getting Python Function Documentation
>
> If you forget the usage of a Python function, you can bring up the Python docstring using the syntax `?function`.  Jupyter will display the docstring in a popup.  In the example above, you would use `?sde_client.Inventory.getTypes` to view the docstring.

Similarly, we can use the `Map` endpoint to lookup the region ID for "The Forge":

![Call and result of looking up "The Forge"](img/ex1_cell4.PNG)

Of course, we only need the type and region ID, so we'll tidy things up in the next cell and extract the fields we need into local variables:

![Extract and save type and region ID](img/ex1_cell5.PNG)

Next, we need to create a date range for the days of market data we'd like to display.  This is straightforward using `datetime` and the Pandas function `date_range`:

![Create a date range for the days we want to plot](img/ex1_cell6.PNG)

With these preliminaries out of the way, we're now ready to start extracting market data.  To do this, we'll need a Swagger client pointing to the Orbital Enterprises market data service.  As a test, we can call this service with the first date in our date range:

![Create a Swagger market data client and extract a day of market history](img/ex1_cell7.PNG)

We call the `history` method on the `MarketData` endpoint passing a type ID, region ID, and the date we want to extract.  This method can only be used to lookup data for a single date, so the result is a single JSON object with the requested information.  The `history` endpoint may not have any data for a date we request \(e.g. because the date is too far in the past, or the service has not yet loaded very recent data\).  It is therefore useful to check what happens when we request a missing date:

![Result of requesting a missing date](img/ex1_cell8.PNG)

The result is a nasty stack trace due to an `HTTPNotFound` exception.  We'll need to handle this exception when we request our date range in case any data is missing.

> ### Using a Response Object Instead of Exceptions
>
> The Bravado client provides an alternative way to handle erroneous responses if you'd prefer not to handle exceptions.  This is done by requesting a `response` object as the result of a call.  To create a `response` object, change your call syntax from:
> ```
> result = client.Endpoint.method(...).result()
> ```
> to:
> ```
> result, response = client.Endpoint.method(...).result()
> ```
> The raw response to a call will be captured in the `response` variable which can be inspected for errors as follows:
>
> ```
> if response.status_code != 200:
>     # An error occurred
>     ...
> ```
> You can either handle exceptions or use response objects according to your preference.  We choose to simply handle exceptions in this example.

Now that we know how to retrieve market history for a single day, we can retrieve our entire date range with a simple loop:

![Retrieve history for our date range](img/ex1_cell9.PNG)

The result is an array of market history, hopefully for every day we requested \(the last day in the range will usually be missing because the market data service hasn't loaded it yet\).  Now that we have our market data, we need to turn it into a plot.  We'll use a Pandas [`DataFrame`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/dsintro.html#dataframe) for this.  If you haven't already, you'll want to read up on Pandas as we'll use its data structures and functions throughout the book.  There are many ways to create a `DataFrame` but in our case the most convenient approach will be to base our `DataFrame` on the array of market data we just loaded.  All that is missing is an index for the `DataFrame`.  The natural choice here is to use the `date` field in each day of market history.  However, these dates are not in a format understood by Pandas so we'll have to convert them.  This is easy to do using `datetime` again.  Here's an example which converts the `date` field from the first day of market history:

![Date conversion for the first day of market history](img/ex1_cell10.PNG)

We'll turn the converter into a function for convenience, then create our `DataFrame`:

![Create a DataFrame from market history](img/ex1_cell11.PNG)

Last but not least, we're ready to plot our data.  Simple plots are very easy to create with a `DataFrame`.  Here, we plot average price for our date range:

![Plot of Average Price](img/ex1_cell12.PNG)

And that's it!  You've just created a simple plot of market history.

We walked through this example in verbose fashion to demonstrate some of the key techniques we'll need for analysis later in the book.  As you develop your own analysis, however, you'll likely switch to an iterative process which may involve executing parts of a notebook multiple times.  You'll want to avoid re-executing code to download data unless absolutely necessary as more complicated analysis will require order book data which is substantially larger than market history.  If you know you'll be doing this often, you may find it more convenient to download historic data to your local disk and read the data locally instead of calling a web service.

All data available on the market data service site we used in this example is uploaded daily to the Orbital Enterprises Google Storage site \(you can find full documentation [here](https://evekit.orbital.enterprises//#/md/main)\).  Historic data is organized by day.  You can find data for a given day at the URL: `https://storage.googleapis.com/evekit_md/YYYY/MM/DD`.  At time of writing, six files are stored for each day[^8]:

|File                        |Description                                                                     |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|market_YYYYMMDD.tgz         |Market history for all regions and types for the given day.                     |
|interval_YYYYMMDD_5.tgz     |Order book snapshots for all regions and types for the given day.               |
|market_YYYYMMDD.bulk        |Market history in "bulk" form for all regions and types for the given day.      |
|interval_YYYYMMDD_5.bulk    |Order book snapshots in "bulk" form for all regions and types for the given day.|
|market_YYYYMMDD.index.gz    |Market history bulk file index for the given day.                               |
|interval_YYYYMMDD_5.index.gz|Order book snapshot bulk file for the given day.                                |

We'll discuss the market history files here, and leave the order book files for the next example.

Historic market data is optimized for two use cases:

1. Download for local storage; and,
2. Efficient online access using HTTP "range" requests.

The tar'd archive files \(e.g. tgz files\), when extracted, contain files of the form `market_TYPE_YYYYMMDD.history.gz` where `TYPE` is the type ID for which history is recorded in the file, and `YYYYMMDD` is the date of the market history.  The content of each file is a comma-separated table of market history for all regions on the given day.  Let's look at a sample file:

```bash
$ wget -q https://storage.googleapis.com/evekit_md/2017/01/01/market_20170101.tgz
$ ls -lh market_20170101.tgz
-rw-r--r--+ 1 mark_000 mark_000 2.2M Jan 31 02:55 market_20170101.tgz
$ tar xvzf market_20170101.tgz
... about 10000 files extracted ...
$ zcat market_34_20170101.history.gz | head -n 10
34,10000025,13,2.89,4.50,4.00,7319512,1483228800000
34,10000027,1,0.28,0.28,0.28,155501,1483228800000
34,10000028,44,4.80,4.80,4.80,12336476,1483228800000
34,10000029,19,2.00,5.00,3.50,41728843,1483228800000
34,10000030,735,4.60,4.76,4.64,419745507,1483228800000
34,10000016,964,3.98,4.66,4.36,225219117,1483228800000
34,10000018,4,2.03,2.03,2.03,3046465,1483228800000
34,10000020,367,4.50,4.50,4.50,264925396,1483228800000
34,10000021,1,4.48,4.48,4.48,4500000,1483228800000
34,10000022,3,1.51,1.51,1.51,10145393,1483228800000
```

The columns in the file are:

* *type ID* - the type ID for the current row.
* *region ID* - the region ID for the current row.
* *order count* - the number of market orders for this type in this region on this day.
* *low price* - low trade price for this type in this region on this day.
* *high price* - high trade price for this type in this region on this day.
* *average price* - average trade price for this type in this region on this day.
* *volume* - daily volume for this type in this region on this day.
* *date* - date of snapshot in milliseconds UTC (since the epoch).

The data stored in the bulk files has the same format but is organized differently in order to support efficient online requests using an HTTP range header.  We construct the bulk file by concatenating each of the individual compressed market files.  This results in a file with roughly the same size as the archive, but which needs an index in order to recover market history for a particular type.  This is the purpose of the market index file, which records the byte range for each market type stored in the bulk file.  Here are the first ten lines for the index file for our sample date:

```bash
$ curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/evekit_md/2017/01/01/market_20170101.index.gz | zcat | head -n 10
market_18_20170101.history.gz 0
market_19_20170101.history.gz 984
market_20_20170101.history.gz 1928
market_21_20170101.history.gz 3678
market_22_20170101.history.gz 4439
market_34_20170101.history.gz 5431
market_35_20170101.history.gz 8953
market_36_20170101.history.gz 12396
market_37_20170101.history.gz 15820
market_38_20170101.history.gz 19108
```

Thus, to recover type 34 we need to extract bytes 5431 through 8952 \(inclusive\) from the bulk file.  We can do this by using an HTTP "range" request as follows:

```bash
$ curl -s -H "range: bytes=5431-8952" https://storage.googleapis.com/evekit_md/2017/01/01/market_20170101.bulk | zcat | head -n 10
34,10000025,13,2.89,4.50,4.00,7319512,1483228800000
34,10000027,1,0.28,0.28,0.28,155501,1483228800000
34,10000028,44,4.80,4.80,4.80,12336476,1483228800000
34,10000029,19,2.00,5.00,3.50,41728843,1483228800000
34,10000030,735,4.60,4.76,4.64,419745507,1483228800000
34,10000016,964,3.98,4.66,4.36,225219117,1483228800000
34,10000018,4,2.03,2.03,2.03,3046465,1483228800000
34,10000020,367,4.50,4.50,4.50,264925396,1483228800000
34,10000021,1,4.48,4.48,4.48,4500000,1483228800000
34,10000022,3,1.51,1.51,1.51,10145393,1483228800000
```

Note that this is the same data we extracted from the downloaded archive.

As an illustration of code which makes use of downloaded data \(if available\), we'll conclude this example with an introduction to library code we'll be using in later examples.  You can find our library code in the [code](https://github.com/OrbitalEnterprises/eve-market-strategies/tree/master/code) folder on our GitHub site.  You can incorporate our libraries into your notebooks by copying the [evekit](https://github.com/OrbitalEnterprises/eve-market-strategies/tree/master/code/evekit) folder \(and all its sub-folders\) to your `.ipython` directory \(or another convenient directory in your Python path\).

We can re-implement this first example using the following modules from our libraries:

1. `evekit.online.Download` - download archive files to local storage.
2. `evekit.reference.Client` - make it easy to instantiate Swagger clients for commonly used services.
3. `evekit.marketdata.MarketHistory` - make it easy to retrieve market history in various forms.
4. `evekit.util` - a collection of useful utility functions.

You can view [this Jupyter notebook](code/book/Example_1_Data_Extraction_With_Libraries.ipynb) to see this example implemented with these libraries.  We didn't actually download any archives in the original example, but we include a download in the re-implemented example to demonstrate how these libraries function.

### Example 2 - Book Data: Compute Average Daily Spread

In this example, we turn our attention to analyzing order book data.  The goal of this example is to compute the average daily *spread* for Tritanium in The Forge region for a given date.  Spread is defined as the difference in price between the lowest priced sell order, and the highest priced buy order.  Among other things, spread is an indication of whether market making will be profitable for a given asset, but we'll get to that in a later chapter.  The average daily spread is the average of the spreads for each order book snapshot.  At time of writing, order book snapshots are generated every five minutes.  So the average daily spread is just the average of the spread computed for each of the 288 book snapshots which make up a day.

We'll start by getting familiar with the order book data endpoint on the [Orbital Enterprises market data service](https://evekit.orbital.enterprises//#/md/ui) site:

![Order book endpoint](img/ex2_order_book_ep.PNG)

There are actually two endpoints, but we're only looking at the historic endpoint for now.  We'll cover the "latest book" endpoint in a later chapter.  As with the market history endpoint, the order book endpoint expects a type ID, a region ID, and a date.  However, the date field may optionally include a time.  The order book snapshot returned by the endpoint  will be the latest snapshot *before* the specified time.  Here's an example of the result returned with type ID 34 \(Tritanium\), region ID 10000002 \(The Forge\), and timestamp `2017-01-01 12:02:00 UTC` \(note that this endpoint can parse time zone specifications properly\):

The `bookTime` field reports the actual timestamp of this snapshot in milliseconds UTC since the epoch.  In this example, the book time is `2017-01-01 12:00 UTC` because that is the latest book snapshot at requested time `2017-01-01 12:02 UTC`.

> ### Pro Tip: Converting Timestamps
>
> If you plan to work with Orbital Enterprises raw data on a frequent basis, you'll want to find a convenient tool for converting millisecond timestamps to human readable form.  The author uses the [Utime Chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/utime/kpcibgnngaaabebmcabmkocdokepdaki?utm_source=chrome-app-launcher-info-dialog) for quick conversions.  You'll only need this when browsing the data manually.  The evekit libraries \(should you choose to use then\) handle these conversions for you.

Orders in the order book are contained in the `orders` array with buy orders appearing first, followed by sell orders.  To make processing easier, buy orders are sorted with the highest priced orders first; and, sell orders are priced with the lowest priced orders first.  Order sorting simplifies spread computations but there's a catch in that a spread is only valid if the highest buy and lowest sell are eligible for matching \(except for price, of course\).  That is, the spread is not always the difference between the highest price buy and the lowest price sell, because those orders may not be matchable.  We see this behavior in the sample output above: the highest price buy order is for 5 ISK, but the lowest price sell order is 4.69 ISK.  Even though the resulting spread would be negative, which can never happen according to market order matching rules, the orders are valid because they can not match: the buy order is ranged to the solar system Otanuomi but the sell order was placed in the Obe solar system.  For the sake of simplicity, we'll limit this example to computing the spread for buy and sell orders at a given station.  We'll use "Jita IV - Moon 4 - Caldari Navy Assembly Plant" which is the most popular station in the Forge region and has location ID 60003760.  In reality, there may be many spreads for a given type in a given region as different parts of the region may have unique sets of matching orders.  Computing proper spreads in this way would also require implementing a proper order matching algorithm which we'll leave to a later example.  For strategies like market making, however, one is normally only concerned with "station spread" which is what we happen to be computing in this example.

We assume you've already installed `bravado` as described in [Example 1](#example-1---data-Extraction-make-a-graph-of-market-history).  If you haven't installed `bravado`, please do so now.  As always, you can follow along with this example by downloading the [Jupyter notebook](code/book/Example_2_Compute_Average_Daily_Spread.ipynb).

The first two cells of this example important standard libraries and configure properties such as `type_id`, `region_id`, `station_id` and `compute_date` which is set to the timestamp of the first order book snapshot we wish to measure.  Note that we use the EveKit library to retrieve an instance of the SDE client:

![Example Setup](img/ex2_cell1.PNG)

We can use the Orbital Enterprises market data client to extract the first book snapshot:

![Order Book Snapshot for Tritanium in The Forge at 2017-01-01 00:00 UTC](img/ex2_cell2.PNG)

Buy and sell orders are conveniently sorted in the result.  We use a filter extract these orders by type \(e.g. buy or sell\) and station ID, then implement a simple spread calculation function to calculate the spread for a set of buys and sells:

![Sort and Compute Spread](img/ex2_cell3.PNG)

Finally, we're ready to compute spread for all 5-minute snapshots on the target date.  We can do this with a simple loop, requesting the next snapshot at each iteration and adding the spread to an array of values which are averaged at the end:

![Compute Spreads for All Snapshots and Average](img/ex2_cell4.PNG)

And with that, you've just computed average daily spread.

As in the first example, we now turn to order book data formats for local storage.  You can find order book files for a given day at the URL: `https://storage.googleapis.com/evekit_md/YYYY/MM/DD`.  Three files are relevant for order book data:

|File                        |Description                                                                     |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|interval_YYYYMMDD_5.tgz     |Order book snapshots for all regions and types for the given day.               |
|interval_YYYYMMDD_5.bulk    |Order book snapshots in "bulk" form for all regions and types for the given day.|
|interval_YYYYMMDD_5.index.gz|Order book snapshot bulk file for the given day.                                |

Note that book data files are significantly larger than market history files as they contain every order book snapshot for every type in every region on a given day.  At time of writing, a typical book index file is about 100KB which is manageable.  However, bulk files are typically 500MB while zipped archives are 250MB.  A year of data is about 90GB of storage.  By the way, the `5` in the file name indicates that these are five minute snapshot files.  In the future, we may generate snapshots with different intervals.  You can easily generate your own sampling frequency using the five minute samples as a source since these these are currently the highest resolution samples available.

The tar'd archive files \(e.g. tgz files\), when extracted, contain files of the form `interval_TYPE_YYYYMMDD_5.book.gz` where `TYPE` is the type ID for which order book snapshots are recorded, and `YYYYMMDD` is the date on which the snapshots were recorded.  The content of each file is slightly more complicated and is explained below.  Here is the contents of a sample file:

```bash
$ wget -q https://storage.googleapis.com/evekit_md/2017/01/01/interval_20170101_5.tgz
$ ls -lh interval_20170101_5.tgz

```

The first two lines indicate the type contained in the file, in this case Tritanium \(type ID 34\),  and the number of snapshots collected for each region, in this case 288 \(a snapshot every five minutes for 24 hours\).  The remainder of the file organizes snapshots per region and is organized as follows:

```
FIRST_REGION_ID
FIRST_REGION_FIRST_SNAPSHOT_TIME
FIRST_REGION_FIRST_SNAPSHOT_BUY_ORDER_COUNT
FIRST_REGION_FIRST_SNAPSHOT_SELL_ORDER_COUNT
FIRST_REGION_FIRST_SNAPSHOT_BUY_ORDER
...
FIRST_REGION_FIRST_SNAPSHOT_SELL_ORDER
...
FIRST_REGION_SECOND_SNAPSHOT_TIME
...
SECOND_REGION_ID
...
```

The columns for each order row are:

* *order ID* - Unique market order ID.
* *buy*	- "true" if this order represents a buy, "false" otherwise.
* *issued* - Order issue date in milliseconds UTC (since the epoch).
* *price* - Order price.
* *volume entered* - Volume entered when order was created.
* *min volume* - Minimum volume required for each order fill.
* *volume* - Current remaining volume to be filled in the order.
* *order range* - Order range string. One of "station", "solarsystem", "region" or a number representing the number of jobs allowed from the station where the order was entered.
* *location ID* - Location ID of station where order was entered.
* *duration* - Order duration in days.

As with market history, the bulk files are simply the concatenation of the per-type book files together with an index to allow efficient range requests.  We can retrieve the same data as above by first consulting the index file:

```bash
$ curl -s https://storage.googleapis.com/evekit_md/2017/01/01/interval_20170101_5.index.gz | zcat | head -n 10
interval_18_20170101_5.book.gz 0
interval_19_20170101_5.book.gz 143131
interval_20_20170101_5.book.gz 234988
interval_21_20170101_5.book.gz 447702
interval_22_20170101_5.book.gz 522083
interval_34_20170101_5.book.gz 619717
interval_35_20170101_5.book.gz 1236236
interval_36_20170101_5.book.gz 1780447
interval_37_20170101_5.book.gz 2208243
interval_38_20170101_5.book.gz 2651627
```

Then sending a range request, in this case to extract bytes 619717 through 1236236 \(inclusive\):

```bash
$ curl -s -H "range: bytes=619717-1236236" https://storage.googleapis.com/evekit_md/2017/01/01/interval_20170101_5.bulk | zcat | head -n 10

```

The format of book files is currently optimized for selection by type, which may not be appropriate for all use cases.  It is usually best to download the book files you need, and re-organize them according to your use case.  The EveKit libraries provide support for basic downloading, including only downloading the types or regions you want.

The second part of the Jupyter Notebook for this example illustrates how to download and compute average spread using the EveKit libraries and Pandas.  This can be done in four steps:

1. We first download the order book for Tritanium in the Forge on the target date.  By filtering the download by type and region, we can avoid downloading the entire 230MB archive file; the file stored on disk is just 104K.
2. We next use the OrderBook class to load book data as a Pandas DataFrame.  The DataFrame stores each order as a row where the index is the time of the book snapshot where the order was listed.  We also add columns for type and region ID to allow for further filtering.  Since the index is just snapshot time, we can recover the individual snapshots by grouping on index.  Each Pandas group then becomes a book snapshot.
3. We re-implement our spread computation function to operate on a DataFrame representing a snapshot instead of an array of buys and sells.  The computation is the same, except that we return "NaN" in cases where there is no well-defined spread.  This is done because the Pandas mean function, which we use in the next step, conveniently ignores NaN values.
4. We finish by combing Pandas "groupby" and "apply" with our spread computation function to compute a series of spreads, which can then be averaged with Pandas "mean".

### Example 3 - Trading Rules: Build a Buy Matching Algorithm

As described in the introductory material in this chapter, sell limit orders do not specify a range.  Buyers explicitly choose which sell orders they wish to buy from and, if the buyer's price is at least as large as the seller's price, then the order will match at the location of the seller \(but at the maximum of the buyer's price and the seller's price; also, the lowest priced asset at the target station always matches first\).  When selling at the market, however, the matching rules are more complicated because buy limit orders specify a range.  In order to figure out whether two orders match, the location of the buyer and seller must be compared against the range specified in the buyer's order.

The analysis of more sophisticated trading strategies will eventually require that you determine which orders you can sell to in a given market.  Thus, in this example, we show how to implement a "buy order matching" algorithm.  Buy matching boils down to determining the distance between the seller and potentially matching buy orders.  We show how to use map data from the Static Data Export \(SDE\) to compute distances between buyers and sellers \(or rather, the distance between the solar systems where their stations reside\).  One added complication is that player-owned structures are not included in the SDE.  Instead, a separate data service must be consulted to map a player-owned structure to the solar system where it is located.  We show how to use one such service in this example.  Finally, we demonstrate the use of our matching algorithm against an order book snapshot.  As always, you can follow along with this example by downloading the [Jupyter Notebook](code/book/Example_3_Buy_Matching_Algorithm.ipynb).

> ### NOTE
>
> This example requires the `scipy` package.  If you've installed Anaconda, then you should already have `scipy`.  If not, then you'll need to install it using your favorite Python package manager.

Let's start by looking at a function which determines whether a sell order placed at a particular station can match a given buy order visible at the same station.  We need the following information to make this determination:

* *region_id* - the ID of the region we're trying to sell in.
* *sell_station_id* - the ID of the station where the sell order is placed.
* *buy_station_id* - the ID of the station where the buy order is placed.
* *order_range* - the order range of the buy order.  This will be one of "region", "solarsystem", "station", or the maximum number of jumps allowed between the buyer and seller solar systems.

Strictly speaking, the region ID is not required as it can be inferred from station ID.  We include the region ID here as a reminder that trades can only occur within a single region: EVE does not currently allow cross-region market trading.  Henceforth, unless otherwise stated, we assume the selling and buying stations are within the same region.

With the information above, we can write the following order matching function:

```python
def order_match(sell_station_id, buy_station_id, order_range):
  """
  Returns true if a sell market order placed at sell_station_id could be matched
  by a buy order at buy_station_id with the given order_range
  """
  # Case 1 - "region"
  if order_range == 'region':
      return True
  # Case 2 - "station"
  if order_range == 'station':
      return sell_station_id == buy_station_id
  # Remaining checks require solar system IDs and distance between solar systems
  sell_solar = get_solar_system_id(sell_station_id)
  buy_solar = get_solar_system_id(buy_station_id)
  # Case 3 - "solarsystem"
  if order_range == 'solarsystem':
      return sell_solar == buy_solar
  # Case 4 - check jump range between solar systems
  jump_count = compute_jumps(sell_solar, buy_solar)
  return jump_count <= int(order_range)
```

There are two functions we need to implement to complete our matcher:

* `get_solar_system_id` - maps a station ID to a solar system ID.
* `compute_jumps` - calculates the shortest number of jumps to get from one solar system to another.

We can implement most parts of these functions using the SDE.  However, if either station is a player-owned structure, then the SDE alone won't be sufficient.  Let's first assume neither station is player-owned and implement the appropriate functions.  For this example, we'll load our Jupyter notebook with region and station information as in previous examples.  We'll also include type and date information so that we can download an order book snapshot for Tritanium to use for testing:

![Example Setup](img/ex3_cell1.PNG)

The next cell contains our order matcher, essentially identical to the code above:

![Buy Order Matching Function](img/ex3_cell2.PNG)

Let's start with the `get_solar_system_id` function.  Since we're assuming that neither station is a player-owned structure, this function will be just a simple lookup from the SDE:

![Solar System ID Lookup](img/ex3_cell3.PNG)

Implementing the `compute_jumps` function, however, is a bit more complicated.  In order to calculate the minimum number of jumps between a pair of solar systems, we first need to determine which solar systems are adjacent, then we need to compute a minimal path using adjacency relationships.  Fortunately, the `scipy` package provides a library to help solve this straightforward graph theory problem.  Our first task is to build an adjacency matrix indicating which solar systems are adjacent \(i.e. connected by a jump gate\).  We start by retrieving all the solar systems in the current region using the SDE:

![Retrieve All Solar Systems](img/ex3_cell4.PNG)

The `solar_map` dictionary will maintain a list of solar system IDs which share a jump gate.  The next bit of code populates the dictionary by fetching solar system jump gates from the SDE:

![Populating Solar System Adjacency](img/ex3_cell5.PNG)

With adjacency determined, we're now ready to build an adjacency matrix.  An adjacency matrix is a square matrix with dimension equal to the number of solar systems, where the value at location \(source, destination\) is set to 1 if source and destination share a jump gate, and 0 otherwise.  Once we've created our adjacency matrix, we use it to initialize a `scipy` matrix object needed for the next step:

![Construct Adjacency Matrix](img/ex3_cell6.PNG)

The last step is to call the appropriate `scipy` function to build a shortest paths matrix from the adjacency matrix.  The result is a matrix where the value at location \(source, destination\) is the number of solar system jumps required to move from source to destination:

![Construct Shortest Path Matrix](img/ex3_cell7.PNG)

With the shortest path matrix complete, we can now implement the `compute_jumps` function:

![Compute Jumps Function](img/ex3_cell8.PNG)

The Jupyter notebook includes a few simple tests to show that this function is working properly.  Now that our basic matching algorithm is complete, we can test it on the book snapshot we extracted.  In this case, we'll test which buy orders could potentially match a sell order placed at our target station.  This can be done with a simple loop:

![Finding Matchable Buy Orders](img/ex3_cell9.PNG)

Although we've found several matches, note that there are several orders for which the solar system ID can not be determined.  This is because these orders have been placed at a player-owned structure.  Another way you can tell this is the case is by looking at the location ID for these orders.  Location IDs greater than 1,000,000,000,000 \(1 trillion\) are generally player-owned structures.  Let's now turn our attention to resolving the solar system ID for player-owned structures.  The CCP supported mechanism is to use the [Universe Structures ESI Endpoint](https://esi.tech.ccp.is/latest/#!/Universe/get_universe_structures_structure_id).  This endpoint returns location information for a player-owned structure if your authenticated account is authorized to access that structure.  If your account is *not* authorized to access a given structure, then you can't view location information, *even* if the buy orders placed from the structure appear in the public market.  This is a somewhat inconvenient inconsistency in EVE's market rules, but fortunately there are third party sites which can be used to discover the location of otherwise inaccessible player-owned structures.  We use one such site in this example, primarily because it doesn't require authentication and setting up proper authentication to use the supported ESI endpoint is beyond the scope of this example.

The third party site we'll use in this example is the [Citadel API](https://stop.hammerti.me.uk/api/) site, which uses a combination of the ESI and crowd-sourced reporting to track information about player-owned structures.  This site provides a very simple API for retrieving structure information based on structure ID.  You can create a client for this site using the EveKit libraries:

![Using the Citadel API to look up structure information](img/ex3_cell10.PNG)

The relevant information for our purposes is `systemId` which is the solar system ID.  With this service, we can implement an improved `get_solar_system_id`:

![Improved solar system ID lookup](img/ex3_cell11.PNG)

which fixes any missing solar systems when we attempt to match orders in our snapshot:

![Proper matches now that all solar systems are resolved](img/ex3_cell12.PNG)

And with that, we've implemented our buy order matcher.

As currently implemented, our matcher makes frequent calls to the SDE which can be inefficient for analyzing large amounts of data.  The remainder of the Jupyter notebook for this example describes library support for caching map information for frequent access.  We end the example with a convenient library function that implements our buy matcher in it's entirety, including resolving solar system information from alternate sources.

### Example 4 - Unpublished Data: Build a Trade Heuristic

The CCP provided EVE market data endpoints provide quote and aggregated trade information.  For some trading strategies \(e.g. market making\), finer grained detail is often required.  For example, which trades matched a buy market order versus a sell market order?  What time of day do most trades occur?  Because CCP does not yet provide individual trade information, we're left to infer trade activity ourselves.  In some cases, we can deduce trades based on changes to existing marker orders, as long as those orders are not completely filled \(i.e. appear in the next order book snapshot\).  Orders which are removed, however, could either be canceled or completely filled by a trade.  As a result, we're left to use heuristics to infer trading behavior.

In this example, we develop a simple trade inference heuristic.  This will be our first taste of the type of analysis we'll perform many times in later chapters in the book.  Specifically, we'll need to derive one or more hypotheses to explain some market behavior; we'll need to do some basic testing to convince ourselves we're on the right track; then, we'll need to perform a back test over historical data to confirm the validity of our hypothesis.  Of course, performing well in a back test is no guarantee of future results, and back tests themselves can be misused \(e.g. over-fitting\).  A discussion of proper back testing is beyond the scope of this example.  We'll touch on this topic as needed in later chapters \(there are also numerous external sources which discuss the topic\).

We'll use a day of order book snapshots for Tritanium in The Forge to test our heuristic.  This example dives more deeply into analysis than previous examples.  We'll find that the "obvious" choice for estimating trades does not work very well, and we'll briefly discuss two hypotheses for how to make a better choice.  We'll show how to perform a basic analysis of these hypotheses, then we'll choose one and show a simple back test evaluating our strategy.  You can follow along with this example by downloading the [Jupyter Notebook](code/book/Example_4_Trade_Heuristic.ipynb).

We begin our analysis using a single day of book data.  A quick review of EVE market mechanics tells us that once an order is placed, it can only be changed in the following ways:

* The price can be changed.  Changing price also resets the issue date of the order.
* The order can be canceled.  This removes the order from the order book.
* The order can be partially filled.  This reduces volume for the order, but otherwise the order remains in the order book.
* The order can be completely filled.  This removes the order from the order book.

Since a partially filled order is the only unambiguous indication of a trade, let's start buy building our heuristic to catch those events.  The following function does just that:

![Initial Trade Heuristic](img/ex4_cell1.PNG)

This function reports the set of inferred trades as a DataFrame:

![Partial Fill Trades](img/ex4_cell2.PNG)

Note that the trade price may not be correct as market orders only guarantee a minimum price \(in the case of a sell\), or a maximum price \(in the case of a buy\).  The actual price of an order depends on the price of the matching order and could be higher or lower.  Note also that we can only be certain of location for sell orders since these always transact at the location of the seller, *unless* a buy order happens to list a range of `station`.

The best way to test our heuristic is to compute trades for a day where market history is also available.  We've done that in this example so that we can load the relevant market history and compare results.  From that comparison, we see that partial only account for a fraction of the volume for our target day:

![Difference Between Trade Heuristic and Historic Data](img/ex4_cell3.PNG)

In this example, partial fills only account for about one third of the trade volume for the day.  That means complete fills make up the majority of daily volume and thus it is important to have a good estimate of these fills.  There are many ways we can estimate complete fills, but a simple strategy is to start with the naive approach of assuming any order which is removed between book snapshots must be a completed fill.  We know this will rarely be correct, but it's possible that the number of removed orders which are actually cancels is small enough to not be significant.  Let's update our trade heuristic to capture these fills in addition to the partial fills we already capture:

![Naive Capture of Complete Fills](img/ex4_cell4.PNG)

How does this version compare?

![Naive Capture Results](img/ex4_cell5.PNG)

As you can see, the naive approach significantly overshoots volume.  This tells us that in fact a significant number of removed orders are actually cancels \(or expiry\).  We'll have to more carefully estimate complete fills.  A careful and complete solution to this problem is beyond the scope of this example.  Instead, we'll now turn to the evaluation of two different strategies for capturing complete fills.  Each strategy starts with a hypothesis which attempts to characterize complete fills.  We conduct a simple analysis of each hypothesis, then implement the idea that seems most promising and show how to set up a simple back test.

Our first hypothesis is that removed orders near the "top of book" are more likely to be fills than cancels.  The "top of book" is the current best bid and ask for a given asset.  In real-world markets, this is a well defined concept because all trading happens at a single location.  In EVE, however, buy orders have ranges so the current top of book varies according to station and the range of buy orders.[^9]  For simplicity, we'll ignore the location issue for now.  We'll define a threshold, `N`, such that a removed order within the first `N` top of book orders will be considered as a complete fill and thus listed as a trade.  The top `N` buy orders are simply the first `N` buy orders sorted by price \(highest price first\).  For sell orders, we can do slightly better since we know a removed sell order must be transacted at the location of the seller.  Therefore, given a sell order at location `L`, we define the top `N` sell orders to be the first `N` sell orders at location `L` sorted by price \(lowest price first\).

This hypothesis sounds promising but let's test it before we commit to adding it to our trade heuristic.  The following functions count the number of trade orders and resulting volume that would be included for a given value of `N`:

![Top N Strategy Test Functions](img/ex4_cell6.PNG)

The following results show the performance of this strategy on our test order book for several values of `N`:

![Top N Strategy Test Results](img/ex4_cell7.PNG)

The first three columns in the results report the value of `N`, the number of complete fills reported, and the volume of complete fills reported.  The fourth column shows the number of fills remaining based on the historic order count after subtracting partial fills and the complete fills reported by this strategy.  Likewise, the fifth column reports remaining volume.  The results of this strategy are not very promising.  We can capture a large portion of the missing volume, but a relatively small portion of the order count.  It is likely that we're capturing a few large cancels with this strategy, thus skewing our results.  Let's look at another strategy.

A second hypotheses is that large fills should be relatively rare.  We would expect that most fills stay within a relatively tight range.  Removed orders with large volume are therefore more likely to be cancels instead of fills.  Taking this hypothesis a step further, we might expect order size to cluster around the simple average of all order volumes \(e.g. an assumption that amounts to order sizes being normally distributed\).  We can spot check this hypothesis by viewing the naive set of trades as a histogram \(recall that this set treats every removed order as a completed fill\):

![Histogram of Volumes for Naive Trade Set](img/ex4_cell8.PNG)

The histogram does show significant clustering near the simple order volume average \(around 4 million in this example\).  A simple strategy, then, would be to set a volume threshold such that any removed order with a volume less than the threshold would be treated as a completed fill; and, any order with a volume greater than the threshold would be treated as a cancel \(and dropped\).  As in the previous example, we can write a simple function to count the number of orders and total volume that would result from this strategy for a given volume threshold:

![Volume Threshold Test Function](img/ex4_cell9.PNG)

We can then test this strategy as before using various thresholds.  Historic average volume for the day seems to be a reasonable threshold, so we'll test with multiples of that volume:

![Volume Threshold Test Results](img/ex4_cell10.PNG)

This strategy does a better job of capturing volume, but overshoots order count.  Neither strategy seems very effective but, arguably, the threshold strategy is the better of the two.  As discussed above, trade estimation is a difficult task the further analysis of which is beyond the scope of this example.  Let us assume that we'll adopt the threshold strategy for now and turn to a back test analysis of this strategy against historic data.

Before we begin our back test, we need to determine the volume threshold to use.  Our analysis used multiples of the historic average volume for testing.  If we did the same for our trade heuristic, then we could only apply the heuristic once historic volume is known.  This would preclude us from inferring trades on the current day which is not ideal for many trading strategies.  Therefore, we will arbitrarily use the moving average of average volume for the previous 10 days of trading.  This allows us to infer trades for the current day once the previous day's historic volume is known.  Based on our analysis above, we will set our volume threshold to be five times the 10-day moving average of average trading volume.  This threshold seemed to capture a reasonable amount of completed fill volume without excessively overshooting the order count.

For reference, here's the final version of our trade inference function:

![Final Version of Trade Heuristic](img/ex4_cell11.PNG)

A "back test" is simply an evaluation of an algorithm over some period of historical data.  For this example, we'll test our strategy over the thirty days prior to our original test date.  The example [Jupyter Notebook](code/book/Example_4_Trade_Heuristic.ipynb) provides cells you can evaluate to download sufficient market data to local storage.  We strongly recommend you do this as book data will take significantly longer to fetch on demand over a network connection.  Once data has been downloaded, our back test is then a simple iteration over the appropriate date range:

![Back Test Loop](img/ex4_cell12.PNG)

We capture the results in a DataFrame for further analysis:

![Back Test Results](img/ex4_cell13.PNG)

We can then view the results of our test comparing inferred trade count and volume with historic values on the same days.  The following graphs show the results of this comparison \(values near zero are better\):

![Inferred Count vs. Historic Count as Percentage](img/ex4_cell14.PNG)
![Inferred Volume vs. Historic Volume as Percentage](img/ex4_cell15.PNG)

Somewhat surprisingly, inferred trade counts perform better over longer stretches than inferred trade volume.  Regardless, we would need to perform a more detailed analysis over a larger set of historical data to have any real confidence in our heuristic.

The EveKit libraries do not attempt to provide any general functions for inferring trades.  The highly heuristic nature of this analysis makes it difficult to provide a standard offering for broad use.  However, the point of this example was to introduce basic analysis techniques which we expect you'll find useful as you develop your own strategies.

### Example 5 - Important Concepts: Build a Liquidity Filter

Thousands of asset types are traded in EVE's markets.  However, as in real-world markets, the frequency of trades and the price range for an asset varies widely according to type.  Trading strategies usually prefer *liquid* asset types, which are those asset types that can be bought or sold at relatively stable prices.  Such asset types are more amenable to analysis and are typically easier to buy and sell as needed in the market.  Real-world traders use liquidity as one of the prime measures for admitting or excluding asset types from their tradable portfolio.  There are many factors that lead to price stability, but often the most important factor is daily volume.  Assets which are traded daily at reasonable volume are more likely to have rich pools of buyers and sellers, and prices are more likely to converge to a stable range.  Additional criteria, such as having roughly balanced buyers and sellers, may also be important.

In this example, we derive a simple liquidity filter.  This is one of the simplest of our preliminary examples, but also one of the most important as a well chosen asset portfolio is key to many strategies.  We focus our efforts on the general framework for testing liquidity.  This framework is pluggable, allowing different filters to be inserted as needed.  We create two example filters to illustrate how to use the framework.  You can follow along with this example by downloading the [Jupyter Notebook](code/book/Example_5_Liquidity_Filter.ipynb).

For this example, we'll look for liquid types in The Forge region and we'll choose to measure liquidity over the 90 days of market snapshots leading up to our reference date.  The choice of date range depends on your trading strategy: if your strategy expects recently liquid assets to remain liquid well into the future, then you should select a longer historical date range; if, instead, you only require assets to remain liquid for the next day or so, then you can select a much shorter historical range.  Likewise, we could also create a liquidity filter based on order book data instead of market snapshots.  This is usually not necessary unless your strategy calls for analyzing liquidity at certain times of day \(some market making strategies may find this information useful\).  The first cell in our notebook sets up are initial parameters:

![Liquidity Filter Setup](img/ex5_cell1.PNG)

If you plan to test and iterate over different liquidity filters, you'll almost certainly want to download market history for the range in question.  The next notebook cell does just that.  Make sure you are on a reasonably fast network connection before you execute this cell:

![Liquidity History Download](img/ex5_cell2.PNG)

Our last bit of setup is to load the set of market types in EVE's markets, then load all relevant market history into a Pandas DataFrame.  An easy way to find the set of marketable assets is to query the SDE Inventory endpoint and select types with a market group ID.  The next two cells handle this final bit of setup:

![Load Marketable Tables and History](img/ex5_cell3.PNG)

As we'll want to experiment with a few different liquidity filters, we'll start by creating a general framework for applying a filter to a range of market history.  Our framework will accept a liquidity filter function which will be passed a region ID, a type ID, and market history for the given region and type over our historical range.  This function will be expected to return `True` if the type should be considered liquid, and `False` otherwise.  Our framework will iterate over every region in our history, then systematically over every type in each region, and will record the set of liquid types.  The following function implements this process:

![Liquidity Test Framework](img/ex5_cell4.PNG)

We mentioned previously that volume, more specifically ISK volume \(e.g. $price \times volume$\), is a common measure of liquidity.  Likewise, the number of transactions on a given day is also a reasonable measure of liquidity.  We can combine these two measures to build our first liquidity filter:

![Volume and Order Count Liquidity Filter](img/ex5_cell5.PNG)

Note that our filter is generated by a *functor* \(a function which returns a function\) to make it easier to experiment with different parameter settings.  This filter requires a type to pass three tests:

1. We must have a minimal number of days of data for the type;
2. The type must have traded a minimum number of times each day; and,
3. The average daily ISK volume must exceed a certain threshold.

Reasonable parameters for this filter may be something like:

* Each type must have traded at least 70% of the days in our range;
* Each type must have traded at least 100 times a day; and,
* The average daily ISK volume for each time must be at least 100 million ISK.

As an example, we can apply this filter against Tritanium \(type 34\) in The Forge as follows:

![Checking Liquidity of Tritanium in The Forge](img/ex5_cell6.PNG)

Not surprisingly, we do indeed find that Tritanium is liquid over our date range.  The next cell checks liquidity across the entire region:

![Finding Liquid Types in The Forge](img/ex5_cell7.PNG)

We've truncated the output, but if you view the notebook you'll see that we've found 286 liquid types over our date range in The Forge.  The next cell shows how to view the type names of our liquid set.

As a second example of a liquidity filter, we note that many assets are more active on weekends as compared to weekdays \(we define a weekend as Friday through Sunday\).  This should not surprise anyone familiar with the behavior of most EVE players.  We see this effect in market data as well.  For example, the following graph compares weekday and weekend volume for Tritanium in The Forge:

![Tritanium Volume on Weekends vs. Weekdays](img/ex5_cell8.PNG)

We, therefore, might expect our liquidity filter to return more types if we only consider weekends.  We can change our filter to do just that as follows:

![Liquidity Filter for Weekends Only](img/ex5_cell9.PNG)

After applying our new filter in our framework \(next cell\), we can compare the two results:

![Liquidity All Days vs. Just Weekends](img/ex5_cell10.PNG)

Our new filter does, indeed, include more types.  We'll use a liquidity filter to help choose profitable assets to trade across regions in the next example.

### Example 6 - A Simple Strategy: Cross Region Trading

In our last introductory example, we'll combine techniques from previous examples to create a strategy for finding profitable cross-region trades.  Cross-region trading \(also called "Hauling"\) is a common occupation for many EVE industrialists.  By choosing the right assets, reasonable profit can be made for players willing to haul cargo between regions.  Distances between main trading centers in each region are non-trivial.  Therefore, it is worthwhile to spend a little time planning and choosing the best assets to trade.  Likewise, we'd prefer to focus on trades which are, historically, consistently profitable.  These trades are more likely to be profitable in the future.  That is not to say that capitalizing on a short-lived trend is not profitable, but that is a different type of analysis we're not considering in this example.  Finally, we'll only consider trades between high security regions in this example.  It is trivial to modify our techniques to consider trades across all regions \(regardless of security status\).  You can follow along with this example by downloading the [Jupyter Notebook](code/book/Example_6_Cross_Region_Trading.ipynb).

Our setup for this example is similar to previous examples.  We first load region information for all 15 high security regions.  We then set a date range for analysis consisting of the 90 days before our reference date.  Our last bit of setup is to retrieve the set of all market types from the Static Data Export \(SDE\).

![Example Setup](img/ex6_cell1.PNG)

We'll base our analysis on market snapshot history.  It is possible to instead use order book history but, as discussed in the previous example, order book level granularity is typically only useful for short term trends or very specific behavior \(such as determining the best times to buy or sell assets\).  The next cell in this example loads market snapshot history for our date range.  As in previous examples, we strongly recommend that you download market data to local storage so you can iterate on your experiments without having to reload data from the network.

![Load Market Data](img/ex6_cell2.PNG)

To trade successfully between regions, we need to: easily acquire assets from a source region; haul to the destination region; and, easily liquidate those same assets.  We argued in the last example that liquidity is a key indicator of the ease with which assets can be acquired or sold at stable prices.  Therefore, our first task will be to determine liquid assets in each region.  These are the only assets we'll consider for our trading strategy.  We'll use the same liquidity apparatus we created in the previous example.  Our liquidity filter will have four tests for each asset type:

1. Market history must exist for a minimum number of days;
2. Average ISK volume must exceed a given threshold;
3. Volume must exceed a given threshold; and,
4. Average price must *not* exceed a given threshold.

The following cell creates a functor which returns this filter.  We use a functor to make it easy to vary the parameters of the filter:

![Liquidity Filter](img/ex6_cell3.PNG)

Initially, we'll parameterize our filter as follows \(for each type\):

1. Market history may not be missing for more than two days in the date range;
2. Average ISK volume must exceed 100M ISK;
3. Volume must exceed 100 units; and,
4. The price of an asset can not exceed 500M ISK.

These parameters are designed to capture a wide range of regularly traded types, but exclude certain low volume and/or high priced types.  Low volume or high priced types are usually thinly traded and may induce more risk than we're comfortable with.  Once we have our parameters set, we can use the liquidity framework to find liquid types across all high security regions:

![Find Liquid Types](img/ex6_cell4.PNG)

Before we move to discovering profitable trades, we need to decide how we'll model trading.  A trading model describes the rules and assumptions around buying and selling assets, including: trading costs we'll incur; our assumptions around how orders will be filled; and, any other features of the market which will affect our strategy.  We can use a simple trading model for this example because we're restricting ourselves to liquid types \(in which, by construction, orders are readily filled\), and because we're modeling relatively coarse behavior \(restricting our analysis to consistently profitable trades, and the large time scale of hauling assets between regions, makes market behavior on smaller time scales less relevant\).  The main aspect of our trading model is, therefore, cost.  We'll assume, for this example, that we're buying and selling assets using limit orders.  Limit orders usually guarantee the best prices in markets and are readily filled on liquid types.  When buying with limit orders, we'll incur a broker fee of no less than 2.5% at Non-Player Character \(NPC\) stations \(with maximum trading skills\).  This means that when buying an asset, the actual cost will be 1.025 times the actual cost of the asset.  When selling with limit orders, we'll incur a broker fee and sales tax.  Sales tax is no less than 1% at NPC stations \(with maximum trading skills\).  Therefore, the proceeds of an asset sale will be 0.965 times the actual sale price of the asset.  We refer to the buy cost multiplier as the "buy cost factor", and correspondingly the "sell cost factor" is the sale cost multiplier.  For this simple example, these two factors make up the bulk of our trading model.

As a final piece of configuration, we specify the following requirements on the performance of our strategy:

1. A trade is considered profitable only if it exceeds a given profit margin; and,
2. A type is only admitted to the strategy if its trades are profitable for a minimum number of days in the date range.

Initially, we'll require a 5% profit margin for profitable trades, and we'll require trades on a type to be profitable at least half the days in our date range.  The next cell initializes our trading model and performance settings:

![Trading Model Settings](img/ex6_cell5.PNG)

Now let's walk through the process of determining profitable trades between a pair of regions.  For this walk through, we'll use Domain as the source region, and The Forge as the destination region.  Our first step is to restrict our attention to types which are liquid in both regions:

![Find Liquid Types in Domain and The Forge](img/ex6_cell6.PNG)

We only want to consider market history restricted to these types in our target regions.  A convenient way to perform this analysis is to construct a merged DataFrame which combines market information for both regions joined on asset type and date.  Given such a DataFrame, we can filter further using our trading model to limit ourselves to types with profitable trades.  Given source region A and destination region B, the profitable rows are those for which:

${\left( B_{avgPrice} \times sellCostF - A_{avgPrice} \times buyCostF \right) \over A_{avgPrice}} \ge profitMargin$

We construct such a DataFrame in the next cell:

![DataFrame Containing Profitable Trades](img/ex6_cell7.PNG)

This DataFrame does not enforce the constraint that each type must trade profitably a minimum number of days in our date range.  We enforce this final constraint with a simple list comprehension.  We use a convenience function to then display the list of profitable types:

![Profitable Trades which Meet All Criteria](img/ex6_cell8.PNG)

That may seem like a small set of tradable instruments but keep in mind that we've only considered two regions.  We finish this two region comparison by adding code to summarize our trading opportunities:

![Trading Opportunity Summary](img/ex6_cell9.PNG)

Despite the small set of trading opportunities, we note that the top opportunity has a margin over 20%.  That is quite respectable for a liquid type.  However, it is often prudent to take a quick look at the price and volume graphs to make sure there are no hidden problems with this trade.  Let's take a look at the price graph first for `Republic Fleet Commander Insignia II` in the date range:

![Source vs. Destination Trade Prices](img/ex6_cell10.PNG)

"Price x" represents the source price, and "price y" represents the destination price.  From the graph, it is clear that the price differential is fairly consistent throughout the date range.  Let's take a look at the volume graph next:

![Source vs. Destination Trade Volume](img/ex6_cell11.PNG)

In this case, volume at the source is considerably lower than volume at the destination.  We can make the following observations from this graph:

1. We'll have to be more patient with our buy orders as it may take a while to accumulate enough assets to justify the haul;
2. We'll likely be hauling smaller volumes unless we're comfortable waiting longer;
3. We should have no trouble selling assets quickly at the destination; and,
4. While the margins are good, the low volume at the source suggests total profits will not be very high.

Now that we know how to find profitable trades between a pair of regions, we can implement a general function which finds profitable trades between all pairs of regions in a given set of market history:

![Trade Opportunity Finder](img/ex6_cell12.PNG)

This function expects a liquidity filter, market history, and parameters which constrain profit margin and profitable days.  The result of this function will be a sorted list of profitable trades ordered by profit margin \(highest margin first\).  The function, as written, is intended to be mostly self-sufficient to make it easy to use elsewhere.  You'll need to include the liquidity framework from one of the earlier cells.  Let's try this function on the complete market history for our date range:

![Evaluating Trade Opportunities on all History](img/ex6_cell13.PNG)

We've used the same liquidity filter as before.  Note that this function may take a few minutes to run as it first calculates liquid types in all regions in the included history.  The next cell shows a nicely formatted summary of the results:

![Trade Opportunity Summary Across Full History](img/ex6_cell14.PNG)

The fact that The Forge is the destination region for most trades should surprise no one familiar with EVE as The Forge is the premier trading hub in New Eden.  From the previous example, we know that some instruments are more liquid on the weekends \(we define the weekend as Friday through Sunday\).  Let's increase our profit margin threshold to 10%, then check the results for weekends:

![Evaluating Trade Opportunities on Weekends Only](img/ex6_cell15.PNG)

In summary form:

![Trade Opportunity Summary for Weekends](img/ex6_cell16.PNG)

We generate a shorter list of results, which is not surprising since we increased the profit margin threshold, but we also display the previous top asset type with `Kernite`.  Let's take a look at the price and volume comparison for `Kernite`.  First prices:

![Kernite Price Comparison](img/ex6_cell17.PNG)

And volume:

![Kernite Volume Comparison](img/ex6_cell18.PNG)

As in the non-weekend case, the price separation is robust across the entire date range \(but remember this is weekends only\).  Even better, volume at the source and destination are very similar.  This suggests we should have little difficulty buying at the source and selling at the destination.  This is likely a good trade if you're willing to make the haul.

In this example, we have focused on trades which have been historically strong trading reasonably liquid assets.  Although there are many trade calculators for EVE, most do not apply a similar standard and simply report which types are profitable to trade **now**.  Such trades are well suited to casual or beginning haulers.  As a career, however, you're likely better off focusing on consistently profitable trades with good margins.

While the analysis above provides convincing evidence for certain hauling routes, it leaves out two important issues.  The first issue is minor: how much should I haul?  Hauling too little will generate small total profit, while hauling too much may risk flooding the market at the destination \(and probably lowering your profit margin\).  A complete analysis of this topic is beyond the scope of this example.  As a simple rule of thumb, consider hauling no more than 10% of the total daily volume at the destination per day.  The logic behind this guidance is that the laws of supply and demand will force you to increase your buy price at the source, and lower your sale price at the destination, in order to increase your market participation.  The result will be a lower profit margin.

The second issue with this analysis is more important: we've completely ignored risk.  As seasoned EVE players know, hauling anything between stations incurs a non-zero chance of getting attacked and losing everything.  A more complete analysis of hauling should include a study of risk and the likely effect on your profit.  We'll cover risk in much more detail in a later chapter.

### Setting up Isolated Environments with Conda

If you installed Jupyter using [Anaconda]() then you already have `conda` which can be used to create isolated environments for experiments.  We use `conda` to first create a minimal base environment with Jupyter and related libraries.  We then clone this environment as needed for our experiments.  Our base environment is created as follows \(this is Windows syntax, adjust as appropriate for your environment\):

```bash
$ conda create -n book_base
$ activate book_base
(book_base) $ conda install jupyter
(book_base) $ conda install pandas
(book_base) $ conda install matplotlib
```

You can then deactivate this environment and clone it later for each isolated environment you'd like to create.  We create our isolated environments as follows:

```bash
$ mkdir exp_1
$ cd exp_1
$ mkdir .ipython
$ mkdir .jupyter
$ cat > setup.bat
@REM execute this before you start jupyter in this environment
@SET JUPYTER_CONFIG_DIR=your_path/exp_1/.jupyter
@SET IPYTHONDIR=your_path/exp_1/.ipython
$ conda create -n book_exp_1 --clone book_base
```

You can then activate your new environment and start jupyter as follows:

```bash
$ activate book_exp_1
(book_exp_1) $ setup.bat
(book_exp_1) $ jupyter notebook
```

The environment settings allow you to add custom configuration for Jupyter or Ipython in your experiment directory.  For example, any library code you are developing can be added in the local `.ipython` directory to automatically be included in the path of your kernels.

[^2]: Moreover, it is not uncommon for buy orders to be placed from non-public player-owned structures.  This is mostly a nuisance for processing market data.
[^3]: Some financial markets have "dark pools" which are off exchange markets, usually reserved for specific types of transactions.  Dark pools do not always guarantee anonymity.
[^4]: Arbitrage and market-making strategies are well suited to automated trading (i.e. "botting").  However, this is explicitly forbidden by the EULA.
[^5]: CCP has an interesting view on the legality of these efforts.  The End User License Agreement (EULA) explicitly forbids cache scraping.  However, CCP has consistently said that they enforce the EULA at their discretion and, practically speaking, they have tolerated scraping market data for many years.  More recently, CCP has said many of their new third party APIs are intended to eliminate the need for cache scraping.  The new market data APIs are a direct result of such efforts.
[^6]: The size of the window for this average, and whether the average is over all regions is not documented anywhere.
[^7]: Whereas iPython mainly supports the Python language, the Jupyter project is more inclusive and intends to provide support for numerous "data science" languages including [R](https://www.r-project.org/) and [Julia](http://julialang.org/).  At time of writing, however, Python is still the best supported language in Jupyter.
[^8]: Currently, the upload process begins around 0200 UTC and takes several hours to assemble and upload data.  Order book data for the previous day is usually available by 0800 UTC.  Market history for the previous day is usually delayed one additional day because CCP does not immediately make the data available.  For example, the data for 2017-01-01 will be processed at 0200 UTC on 2017-01-02.  However, CCP will not provide the market history snapshot for 2017-01-01 until several hours into 2017-01-02 \(i.e. after we've already started processing data for the previous day\).  This data will instead be uploaded at 0200 UTC on 2017-01-03.
[^9]: An obvious variant of this heuristic is to assume that most volume occurs at the most active station in the region, at which the top of book is well defined \(since the location is fixed\).  You can use the order matcher from [Example 3](#example-3---trading-rules-build-an-order-matching-algorithm) to derive the proper top of book at a given station.  We leave this variant as an exercise for the reader.

# Arbitrage

In real-world markets, arbitrage is the process of simultaneously purchasing and selling an asset \(or similar assets\) in different markets.  An arbitrage trade exploits price differences between the same asset in different markets, or between an asset and related assets in the same market.  Such differences occur because of market inefficiencies.  That is, when the price of an asset deviates from *fair market value*, which is the price at which "reasonably knowledgeable" investors are willing to trade an asset.  A "reasonably knowledgeable" investor is assumed to be implicitly aware of all the factors which influence an asset's price, which are then incorporated to select a fair price for trade.  Trading strategies we'll discuss in later chapters derive their profit from these price deviations and their eventual correction.  Price correction, however, is not required for arbitrage.  In fact, arbitrage strategies only profit while price discrepancies exist.  Can we ever be sure price discrepancies *do* exist?  Generally speaking, we don't know that this will ever be the case.  In particular, subscribers to the [Efficient-Market Hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efficient-market_hypothesis), which states that asset prices always \(eventually\) converge to fair market value, might say that price discrepancies are either non-existent or too rare to be profitable in a modern market.  In EVE, however, we'll show that these opportunities do exist and make a respectable profit.

In EVE markets, an arbitrage trade of the same asset in different markets is not possible without hauling[^10].  Instead, arbitrage opportunities in EVE are based on assets which can be refined or reprocessed into related assets which are also sold on the market.  This type of arbitrage is similar to [Index Arbitrage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_arbitrage) in real-world markets.  For example, raw ores like Veldspar can be traded on the market.  But Veldspar can also be refined into Tritanium which can *also* be traded on the market.  Therefore, the fair market value of Veldspar is dependent on the price of Tritanium.  If the price of Veldspar deviates far enough below fair market value, it may become profitable to buy Veldspar, refine it to Tritanium, and sell the Tritanium.  This is the essence of the trading strategies we discuss in this chapter.

The rest of this chapter will explore arbitrage opportunities in EVE.  Impatient readers may wonder whether their time is well spent on this strategy.  Are arbitrage opportunities profitable?  If so, how much?  We won't make a habit of this, but let's take a look at performance we've been able to achieve here at Orbital Enterprises.  The following graph shows performance of our arbitrage based strategy from November 2016 through March 2017:

![Performance of an Actual Arbitrage Strategy](img/ch2_fig1.PNG)

We seeded our portfolio with 2B ISK, then executed our arbitrage strategy across the five main trading regions of EVE using only our starting balance.  We use three EVE characters to conduct our trading, placed strategically in the most active markets.  As of this writing, our balance is over 38B ISK for a profit of over 36B ISK in just under five months, or an average of about 7B ISK/month.  We haven't run the strategy long enough to uncover any seasonal effects, but it's clear late fall was more profitable than more recent returns.  We currently estimate a comfortable run rate of at least 3B ISK/month.  Compared to typical real-world market strategies, these returns are outstanding.

## What Makes Arbitrage Possible?

Before we get too far into analyzing arbitrage opportunities, it is worth briefly discussing why arbitrage is possible at all.  At its root, arbitrage is made possible by one or both of the following market behaviors:

1. when the ask price of a source material falls below fair market value price as determined by the reprocessing equation \(see below\); and/or,
2. when the bid price of one or more refined materials rises above fair market value price as determined by the reprocessing equation.

There are many reasons why prices may move.  Given our knowledge of EVE player behavior, we know that some players regularly dispose of unwanted assets at cheap prices on the market.  We also know that some players focused on mining choose to trade raw ores directly as they may lack the skills to make trading refined materials possible.  Finally, we know that there are regular spikes in refined material prices as these materials are used to build the favored assets needed for wars and general PvP.

The fact that arbitrage depends on market price moves means it is possible in some cases to actually *predict* when good opportunities will occur.  We discuss once such strategy [below](#capture-dumping-with-buy-orders).  More generally, any price forecast algorithm has the potential to be used to predict arbitrage opportunities.

## Ore and Ice Refinement Arbitrage

We first consider arbitrage on ore and ice.  These asset types are organized into families of which there are six variants for each family.  The first three variants differ in refining yield and output \(for ice\).  The second three variants are "compressed" versions of the first three in which the same yield and output is achieved from a smaller volume of raw material.  There are currently sixteen ore families and four ice families, giving a total of 120 variants which can be refined into minerals and other raw materials.  An arbitrage opportunity exists if a variant can be purchased at a low enough price such that refining and selling the refined materials yields a profit.

We won't describe ore and ice refinement in detail here.  We refer interested readers to the [Reprocessing page](https://wiki.eveuniversity.org/Reprocessing) at EVE University[^11]. For our discussion, it suffices to know that each ore or ice variant has an "ideal" refining output which is adjusted by the efficiency of the refining station and the skills of the refining player.  The refining process is taxed at a rate computed from a reference price, a station tax rate and the yield of raw materials.  We can combine the yield and tax of the refinement process with market data to determine whether an arbitrage opportunity exists, as well as the expected profit.  We can describe this process in formal terms using the following definitions:

* $r$ - an ore or ice type to be refined.
* $r_m$ - the amount of material required for one refinement cycle.
* $e$ - refinement efficiency computed from station efficiency and player skills.  This will be a value between 0 and 1.
* $m(r) \rightarrow {(c_1, v_1), ..., (c_n, v_n)}$ - a map from source material to a set of refined materials $(c_i, v_i)$ where $c_i$ represents the refined material type, and $v_i$ represents the ideal quantity produced when refining $r_m$ units of $r$.
* $p_r(t)$ - the reference price for an asset \(i.e. a price computed daily by CCP, see below\).
* $p_a(t)$ - the current best ask price for an asset \(i.e. the minimum price at which the asset can be purchased\).
* $p_b(t)$ - the current best bid price for an asset \(i.e. the maximum price at which the asset can be sold\).
* $t$ - sales tax for the refining player.  This will be a value between 0 and 1.
* $s_t$ - station refining tax which is affected by player standings towards the station.  This will be a value between 0 and 0.05.

For a given source material $r$, with refined material set $(c_1, v_1), ..., (c_n, v_n)$, the amount of refined material $c_i$ produced by refining $r_m$ units of $r$ is $v_i \times e$.  The total tax charged for the refinement process is $\sum_i\left(v_i \times e \times s_t \times p_r(c_i)\right)$.  Therefore, an arbitrage opportunity exists if the following equation is non-negative:

$\sum_i\left(v_i \times e \times \left[(1 - t) \times p_b(c_i) - s_t \times p_r(c_i)\right] \right) -  r_m \times p_a(r)$

The first term is a simplification of the equation:

$\sum_i\left(v_i \times e \times p_b(c_i)\right) - \sum_i\left(v_i \times e \times p_b(c_i) \times t \right) - \sum_i\left(v_i \times e \times s_t \times p_r(c_i)\right)$

which is, respectively, the profit from selling the refined materials, less sales tax and less refinement tax.  The last term \($r_m \times p_a(r)$\) in the opportunity equation is the cost of buying the ore or ice to refine.

The only factors in this equation which can be influenced by the player are efficiency and station refining tax.  Station refining tax is based on player standings towards the refining station and starts at 5%.  At time of writing, this tax is 0% if standing is 6.67 or better.  Efficiency is determined by the product of the following attributes:

* Station base refining efficiency \(a value between 0 and 1\).
* Reprocessing skill multiplier which is $1.0 + 0.03 \times {level}$ for a maximum of $1.15$.
* Reprocessing efficiency skill multiplier which is $1.0 + 0.02 \times {level}$ for a maximum of $1.10$.
* Ore specific processing skill multiplier \(ores only\) which is $1.0 + 0.02 \times {level}$ for a maximum of $1.10$.
* Ice processing skill multiplier \(ice only\) which is $1.0 + 0.02 \times {level}$ for a maximum of $1.10$.
* Refining implant multiplier if the refining player has an appropriate implant \(e.g. Zainou 'Beancounter' Reprocessing\).

In our research, we've found opportunities at various efficiency levels.  Thus, it is not necessary to train all skills to level 5 to benefit from ore or ice arbitrage.  However, you *will* need to train to maximum skills to maximize your profit.  It is also the case that player-owned structures can have higher base refining efficiency than NPC structures \(which typically have a base efficiency of $0.5$\).  Therefore, moving ore or ice to a player-owned structure may increase yield and hence profit.  However, this is only practical if you have a ship large enough to transfer assets efficiently.  You also incur the risk of losing your ship in transit.  A more practical approach is to look for arbitrage opportunities at player-owned structures which host both refining and market services.

With the theory established, we'll turn now to developing code to detect arbitrage opportunities.

### Example 7 - Detecting Ore and Ice Arbitrage Opportunities

In this example, we'll develop code to look for arbitrage opportunities using a day of order book market data.  You can follow along with this example by downloading the [Jupyter Notebook](code/book/Example_7_Ore_and_Ice_Arbitrage.ipynb).

The setup for this example is to choose a region, station and reference date.  Our goal is to find opportunities to buy ore or ice at our chosen station, then sell refined materials for a profit at the same station.  In this example, we'll use 'Jita IV - Moon 4 - Caldari Navy Assembly Plant' as our station in The Forge region.  Players familiar with EVE will know this is easily the busiest station in high security space.  The following cell shows our setup:

![Region and Station Setup](img/ex7_cell1.PNG)

Since we're focusing on ore and ice types, we'll need to extract type information, including refined material output for each type.  We need two pieces of information for each type we wish to refine:

1. The minimum portion size required for one refinement cycle.
2. The set of materials the type refines to, including the amount of each refined material at perfect efficiency.

For this example, we build a type map from refined asset type to type information including the items above.  We'll use this type map in our arbitrage calculations later in the example.  The next cell shows the creation of the type map:

![Type Map Creation](img/ex7_cell2.PNG)

Next, we extract order book data for our reference date.  Order book data is substantially large than market history snapshots.  Thus, we recommend that you download this data locally to make it easier to experiment with different arbitrage configurations.  We load a day of order book data into a DataFrame for further analysis:

![Download and Load Order Book](img/ex7_cell3.PNG)

As a last initialization step, we'll need to choose values for efficiency, sales tax, and station tax rate.  For this example, we've initialized these values as follows:

* $efficiency = 0.5 \times 1.15 \times 1.1 \times 1.1$ - this represents efficiency at a typical NPC station with maximum skills \(but no implants\).
* $salesTax = 0.01$ - this represents sales tax at a typical NPC station with maximum skills.
* $stationTax = 0.04$ - this is an empirical estimation which accounts for replacing market reference prices with actual prices \(see below\).

Now we're ready to look for arbitrage opportunities.  The equations we derived above are suitable for checking whether an arbitrage opportunity exists, but do not reflect how we'd typically go about looking for opportunities in data.  An actual strategy for finding arbitrage opportunities would need to simulate buying source material \(based on order book data\), then simulate refining and selling the refined materials \(also using order book data\).  We would execute this procedure on every snapshot of a historical day of data, or on the latest snapshot if we are running our strategy live.  The following pseudo-code describes a basic arbitrage opportunity finder for a day of order book data:

```
for each snapshot S:
  for each refinable asset r:
    let r_m = minimum refinable volume for r
    while profitable:
      determine whether we can buy r_m units of r
      if buy successful:
        let cost = cost of buying r_m units of r
        let gross = 0
        compute the refined materials for r_m units of r
        for each refined material m:
          determine whether we can sell m
          if sell successful:
            let gross = gross + proceeds from selling m
            let cost = cost + incremental reprocessing tax for m
          else:
            let gross = 0
            break
        if gross > cost:
          record opportunity
	else:
	  # no longer profitable
	  break
      else:
        # no more source material to buy
        break
```

This process considers all refinable assets for each snapshot.  The check for an opportunity consists of first attempting to buy enough volume of a refinable asset, then attempting to sell the refined materials.  If the gross proceeds from selling the refined materials exceeds the cost of buying the refined asset, plus reprocessing tax, then the opportunity is profitable.  We can determine whether it is possible to buy a refinable asset, or whether it is possible to sell a refined material, by consulting orders in the order book.  We maximize the profit for a given refinable asset by continuing to buy and refine until it is no longer profitable to do so.

Maximizing each opportunity is complicated because the state of orders must be maintained between each refinement cycle.  That is, orders must be "used up" as we buy and sell material over several refinement cycles.  For now, we'll implement a much simpler process which only attempts to find the *first* opportunity in a snapshot for each refinable type.  We'll derive a maximizing process later in the example.  The first function we'll implement attempts to buy enough source material at the given station to allow reprocessing to occur.  The needed volume may be filled over multiple orders.  Thus, the result of this function is a list of order pairs $(p_1, v_1), ..., (p_n, v_n)$ representing the prices and volumes of orders which were filled to buy the necessary material.  An empty list is returned if sufficient material can't be purchased:

![Buying Source Material](img/ex7_cell4.PNG)

A similar function is needed to sell refined material.  As we noted in [Example 3](#example-3---trading-rules-build-an-order-matching-algorithm), our sell algorithm must properly handle ranged buy orders.  We use the `TradingUtil` class we introduced in Example 3 to handle ranged orders properly:

![Selling Refined Material](img/ex7_cell5.PNG)

As with buying source material, our sell function will return a list of order pairs showing the prices and volumes of the orders used to complete our sell order.  If the refined material could not be sold, then an empty list is returned.

We're now ready to implement a basic opportunity checker:

![Basic Opportunity Checker](img/ex7_cell6.PNG)

The code looks complicated but it's really just an implementation of the pseudo-code above.  The main steps are:

1. Iterate through every snapshot in our order book.
2. Iterate through every refinable ore or ice.
3. Attempt to buy enough source material to refine.
4. Use the type map to determine how much refined material is produced.
5. Attempt to sell all refined material.
6. If we can sell the refined material at a profit, then record the opportunity.

The main costs are the initial purchase of the source material and the refinement tax which is charged incrementally for each refined material.  The main proceeds are the sale of refined materials less sales tax.  We're now ready to run our opportunity checker.  Note that this next cell will take several minutes to execute as we're processing an entire day of order book day \(288 snapshots\).  Incremental progress is displayed as we process snapshots:

![Checking for Opportunities](img/ex7_cell7.PNG)

We've defined a simple opportunity display function in the next cell.  Let's take a look at the results:

![Opportunity Results](img/ex7_cell8.PNG)

If you scroll down in the notebook, you'll see we detected 654 total opportunities.  For each opportunity, we report profit and *return* which is profit divided by total cost.  Return is the payout you get for risking your money on an opportunity.  All things being equal, a higher return is better.  However, arbitrage is somewhat unique in that we can tolerate low return if we can take advantage of an opportunity quickly enough \(more on this below\).

There seem to be many opportunities on our reference date, but to really value these opportunities, we need to maximize each one by buying and refining until it is no longer possible to do so.  Maximizing this way will tell us the value of each opportunity, and give us some idea of the total value of the entire day.  As we noted above, executing multiple refinement cycles for an opportunity requires that we keep order book state so we can update orders as we consume them.  The main modification, therefore, will be to our functions for buying source material and selling refined material.  We modify our "buy" function by passing in an order list instead of a snapshot.  We assume this order list represents the available sell orders for a given source material at a given location:

![Buy Function on Order Lists](img/ex7_cell9.PNG)

Our buy function has the side effect that orders in the order list we pass are updated to reflect consuming volume to fill our order.  We make a similar change to our sell function:

![Sell Function on Order Lists](img/ex7_cell10.PNG)

Our sell function has the same side effect as our buy function: orders in the order list are updated as they are consumed.  Since we'll be manipulating order lists frequently, our next cell \(not shown\) implements convenience functions for extracting buy and sell orders from a snapshot into an order list.  We're now ready to write a function which attempts to find and maximize an opportunity on a single refinable type:

![Maximizing an Opportunity on a Single Type](img/ex7_cell11.PNG)

The main change from our initial opportunity finder is the introduction of a loop which attempts to buy and refine source material as long as it is profitable to do so.  The result of this function is either `None` if no opportunity exists, or an object which describes the opportunity with the following values:

* *gross* - gross proceeds from selling refined materials \(less sales tax\).
* *cost* - total cost of purchasing source material, including reprocessing tax.
* *profit* - i.e. *gross* - *cost*.
* *margin* - *profit* / *cost*.
* *buy orders* - the list of all buy orders of source material.  Orders are aggregated by price.
* *sell orders* - a map from refined material type ID to the list of all sell orders for that type.  Orders are aggregated by price.

Finally, we can finish our opportunity finder with an outer loop that iterates through all snapshots and types:

![Finished Opportunity Finder](img/ex7_cell12.PNG)

Let's execute our new finder on our reference date.  Note that this execution will take much longer than our previous opportunity finder as each opportunity may require multiple refine iterations.  We can then display the results as before:

![Maximized Opportunity Results](img/ex7_cell13.PNG)

The same number of opportunities are found as before, but now we have information on the full extent of each opportunity.  Opportunities early in our sample day look very promising.

Based on our sample day, it looks like ore and ice arbitrage may be a viable trading strategy.  The next step is to perform a back test over a longer date range to see if arbitrage opportunities are common, or if we were just fortunate to pick this particular sample date.  Our back test should report the total value of opportunities for each day.  Note, however, that the same opportunity often persists over multiple consecutive snapshots.  Thus, simply adding all the opportunities for a day would be misleading.  Instead, we'd like to collapse multiple instances of the same opportunity into a single instance.  A simple way to do this is to collapse all consecutive opportunities for the same source material into one opportunity.  We can arbitrarily choose the first time the opportunity appears to be the representative for all consecutive appearances.  This approach isn't perfect.  It's possible that two consecutive opportunities for the same source material are, in fact, two different opportunities.  However, this simple approach will allow a reasonable approximation of the value of a day of opportunities.

The next cell \(not shown\) defines the `clean_opportunities` function which "flattens" a list of opportunities as described above.  Flattening our maximized results produces the following list and summary statistics:

![Flattened Opportunities for Sample Date](img/ex7_cell14.PNG)

From the summary results, ore and ice arbitrage seems like a promising strategy.  At 50M ISK per day, this strategy would be worth about 1.5B ISK per month with little risk \(more on that below\).  Note, also, that we've only analyzed opportunities in one region.  Other regions are likely to present opportunities as well, although one would expect these to be less frequent based on overall volume levels.  The next example constructs a back test to determine whether the long term behavior of this strategy matches the results of our sample day.

### Example 8 - Ore and Ice Arbitrage Back Test

Our initial analysis in the previous example showed that ore and ice arbitrage may be a profitable strategy.  In this example, we'll back test the strategy against a longer time range in the same region trading from the same station as in the previous example.  Our goal is to answer these key questions:

1. What are the average and median daily returns?
2. What are the average and median daily profits?
3. Are some days of the week more profitable \(or return better\) than others?
4. Are certain times of day more profitable \(or return better\) than others?
5. Are certain source materials more profitable \(or return better\) than others?

Answers to these questions will help determine the long term viability of our strategy.

We'll conduct our back test over the three month period from 2017-01-01 to 2017-03-31.  The date range is arbitrary.  We chose this date range because it is near time of writing.  Before using any strategy, it is prudent to conduct your own back test with an appropriate date range.

Unlike previous examples, we won't provide a Jupyter notebook which performs the back test.  The reason is that this back test is rather time intensive, especially if run linearly for each date in the date range \(as a simple Jupyter notebook would do\).  Moreover, this back test is [embarrassingly parallel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embarrassingly_parallel), making it much simpler to run offline with a simple script.  To that end, we provide the [`ore_ice_arb_backtest.py`](code/book/ore_ice_arb_backtest.py) script which has the following usage:

```bash
$ python ore_ice_arb_backtest.py YYYY-MM-DD output.csv
```

This command will find all ore and ice opportunities on the given date and write those opportunities in CSV format to the specified file.  To run the complete back test, simply run this command for every date in the date range.  If you have a reasonably powerful machine, you will be able to run multiple dates in parallel.  When all dates complete, you can concatenate all the output files to make a single results file with all opportunities for our date range.

Assuming you've generated back test data \(you can also use our data which is available at [ore_ice_arb_backtest_20170101_20170131.csv.gz](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6lvkwGmS7a2SDBYRmJwVjhiTm8)\), we now turn to a [Jupyter notebook](code/book/Example_8_Ore_Ice_Arbitrage_Backtest.ipynb) which shows our analysis of the results.  We start by reading the opportunities file into a simple array:

![Read Collected Opportunities](img/ex8_cell1.PNG)

Next, we "clean" opportunities as in the previous example.  Cleaning joins adjacent opportunities for the same type in order to make daily profit calculations more accurate:

![Cleaning Opportunities](img/ex8_cell2.PNG)

To start, we'll group the results by day and look at a graph of profit over time:

![Daily Profit](img/ex8_cell3.PNG)

The results show a clear outlier which will make it difficult to determine whether this strategy is viable long term.  Even though the outlier might, in fact, be a valid opportunity, it is better to remove it for our analysis so that we can more accurately predict more typical behavior.  This outlier may be due to a single opportunity, or a small collection of opportunities.  To better understand the nature of the outlier, we'll graph profit for all opportunities over time:

![Profit for All Opportunities](img/ex8_cell4.PNG)

From this graph, it appears there are actually two significant outliers.  Removing opportunities above 150M ISK should be sufficient for our analysis.  Applying that adjustment, we can group by day and graph daily profit:

![Daily Profit (Less Outliers)](img/ex8_cell5.PNG)

as well as daily return \(profit / cost\):

![Daily Return](img/ex8_cell6.PNG)

From these results, it doesn't appear that our results from our test day are very common.  Profits are consistently in the small millions, and returns are likewise consistently in the low single digits.  We can confirm our intuition by computing daily average and median statistics:

![Daily Aggregates](img/ex8_cell7.PNG)

The aggregates confirm that while this strategy is profitable, we probably shouldn't focus on this approach to the exclusion of all others.  Despite the disappointing returns, let's continue our analysis to see if there is any other interesting behavior.

We know from experience that EVE tends to be more active on weekends.  Do we see the same behavior in arbitrage opportunities?  Let's look at number of opportunities and total profit grouped by day of the week:

![Opportunities (bar) and Profit (line) by Day of Week](img/ex8_cell8.PNG)

With the caution that we're only looking at three months of data in a single region, we can draw some interesting conclusions from these results:

* Tuesday has a slight edge in terms of number of opportunities, but is the clear favorite in terms of profitability.
* Despite having a large opportunity count, the weekends are not as profitable as we might expect.
* Sundays, in particular, have surprisingly low profit given the number of opportunities.

If you can only spend one day a week executing your strategy, then these results say Tuesday is the day you should choose.

What about time of day?  Grouping by hour of the day answers that question:

![Opportunities (bar) and Profit (line) by Hour of Day](img/ex8_cell9.PNG)

The count of opportunities shows a very clear progression from fewest opportunities around midnight UTC, peaking with the most opportunities at 21:00 UTC.  Profit does not quite line up with the opportunity count, however.  It's not clear whether we can infer any guidelines for our trading from this data.  Note that we could combine our day of week results with hour of day results to attempt to infer the best time of day for opportunities on known high count days \(e.g. Tuesday\).  We leave this variant as an exercise for the reader.

For our final bit of analysis, let's look at the data grouped by source material type:

![Opportunities (bar) and Profit (line) by Type](img/ex8_cell10.PNG)

We've sorted this graph by opportunity count as it seems likely that ore families will naturally group together.  In fact, we do see a distinct grouping in the plagioclase family.  This is perhaps not surprising given that plagioclase is a profitable ore in The Forge.  Conversely, an analysis in Domain might show Kernite as a more dominant ore for the same reason.  Some other pairs of ore also show grouping.  In terms of profitability, compressed dark glitter \(an ice\) is a clear outlier with a large number of opportunities as well.  This might be a focus for competitively priced bid orders to try to capture industrialists dumping excess stock on the market.

This completes our back test of our ore and ice arbitrage strategy.  Our results show that this strategy is profitable, but certainly not enough to be the main focus of any trader.  In our [Sample Trading Strategy](#a-sample-trading-strategy) section below, we recommend periodically checking for these opportunities in an automated fashion.

Now we turn our focus to scrapmetal reprocessing as an arbitrage strategy.

## Scrapmetal Processing Arbitrage

We started our discussion on arbitrage by looking at opportunities based on ore and ice. In fact, most asset types in EVE can processed through the "scrapmetal" game mechanic which is identical to ore and ice reprocessing except for efficiency, which is affected by different skills.  As above, we can describe the scrapmetal processing mechanic in terms of the following definitions:

* $r$ - an asset type to be reprocessed (*not* ice or ore).
* $r_m$ - the amount of material required for one reprocessing cycle.
* $e$ - reprocessing efficiency computed from station efficiency and player skills.  This will be a value between 0 and 1.
* $m(r) \rightarrow {(c_1, v_1), ..., (c_n, v_n)}$ - a map from source type to a set of reprocessed types $(c_i, v_i)$ where $c_i$ represents the reprocessed type, and $v_i$ represents the ideal quantity produced when reprocessing $r_m$ units of $r$.
* $p_r(t)$ - the reference price for an asset \(i.e. a price computed daily by CCP, see below\).
* $p_a(t)$ - the current best ask price for an asset \(i.e. the minimum price at which the asset can be purchased\).
* $p_b(t)$ - the current best bid price for an asset \(i.e. the maximum price at which the asset can be sold\).
* $t$ - sales tax for the reprocessing player.  This will be a value between 0 and 1.
* $s_t$ - station reprocessing tax which is affected by player standings towards the station.  This will be a value between 0 and 0.05.

Given these definitions, an arbitrage opportunity exists if the following equation is non-negative:

$\sum_i\left(v_i \times e \times \left[(1 - t) \times p_b(c_i) - s_t \times p_r(c_i)\right] \right) -  r_m \times p_a(r)$

Note that this equation is identical to the refining opportunity equation in the previous section.  What makes scrapmetal processing different is the computation of efficiency which is determined by the following attributes:

* Station base refining efficiency \(a value between 0 and 1\).
* Scrapmetal Processing skill multiplier which is $1.0 + 0.02 \times {level}$ for a maximum of $1.10$.

There are currently no implants which affect scrapmetal processing.  As a result, maximum efficiency is much lower for scrapmetal processing as compared to ore and ice reprocessing.  However, there are many more asset types eligible for scrapmetal processing.  As we'll see below, this difference provides many more opportunities for market price imbalances which lead to arbitrage opportunities.  We'll take a look at a day of scrapmetal processing arbitrage opportunities in the next example.

### Example 9 - Detecting Scrapmetal Arbitrage Opportunities

In this example, we'll repeat the analysis we performed in [Example 7](example-7---detecting-ore-and-ice-arbitrage-opportunities), replacing ore and ice with all assets eligible for scrapmetal processing.  Because of the number of types eligible for processing, we won't generate opportunities using a Jupyter notebook.  At time of writing, there are about 8000 types we need to analyze to test for opportunities.  The most effective way to scan for opportunities is take take advantage of the embarrassingly parallel nature of the opportunity search.  Despite this optimization, analysis of a single day takes about four hours on our equipment, which is not very interesting as an illustrative example in a Jupyter notebook.  Instead, we'll use a script to generate a list of opportunities offline, then we'll load the data into a Jupyter notebook for analysis.  Our offline script, [`scrap_single_day.py`](code/book/scrap_single_day.py), has the following usage:

```bash
$ python scrap_single_day.py YYYY-MM-DD output.csv
```

As noted above, this script will take some time to execute.  Knowledgeable readers will find it beneficial to edit this script to take advantage of all available CPU cores on their particular system \(we use 10 cores on our equipment\).  We'll review the results of our single day opportunity finder for the remainder of this example.  You can follow along by downloading the [Jupyter Notebook](code/book/Example_9_Scrapmetal_Arbitrage.ipynb).

We start by loading our offline results into our notebook \(if you haven't generated your own data, you can use our data at [scrap_backtest_20170110.csv.gz](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6lvkwGmS7a2ci1MMmZwRDdtX28)\):

![Load and Sort Single Day Scrap Opportunities](img/ex9_cell1.PNG)

A consequence of our offline script is that results for the day are not in order, so we sort results by time after loading.  Next, we "clean" our results, as in previous examples, by collapsing adjacent instances of the same opportunity into the first instance.  We do this in the next cell \(not shown\).  Once we have cleaned results, we can take a look at opportunities for the day:

![Single Day Opportunities](img/ex9_cell2.PNG)

Our results show almost 800 distinct opportunities for the day, more than we found on the same day for ore and ice.  Many of these opportunities are small, but there are also a few large results as well.  Computing a daily summary should give us an idea of the total opportunity available:

![Single Day Summary](img/ex9_cell3.PNG)

Returns are not much better than in the ore and ice case, but profit is about three times better.  If these results are typical, then we'd expect a run rate of about 4.5B ISK per month which is very respectable given the low risk and effort required to run this strategy.  The only way to increase our certainty is to run a longer back test.  We take on that task in our next example, including a more detailed analysis of the results.

### Example 10 - Scrapmetal Arbitrage Back Test

In this example, we continue our analysis from the previous example, this time extending our analysis over a three month back test.  We'll once again consider the same questions we considered in [Example 8](example-8---ore-and-ice-arbitrage-back-test):

1. What are the average and median daily returns?
2. What are the average and median daily profits?
3. Are some days of the week more profitable \(or return better\) than others?
4. Are certain times of day more profitable \(or return better\) than others?
5. Are certain source materials more profitable \(or return better\) than others?
6. What is the distribution of opportunities?
7. Which opportunities are the most important to capture?

We'll conduct our back test over the same three month period we used for ore and ice: 2017-01-01 to 2017-03-31, inclusive.  We'll use the same offline script we used in the previous example to generate opportunity data for our date range.  The execution of the script is the same as described in the previous example, except that we execute for every day in our date range.  On our equipment, each day of data takes about four hours to generate.  Fortunately, you can run all the days in parallel if you wish.  When all runs complete, you'll have separate output files which can be concatenated into a single file of results.  Note that opportunities will be unsorted if you use our script.  We sort the data as part of our Jupyter notebook below.

Assuming you've generated back test data \(you can also use our data which is available at [scrap_backtest_20170101_20170331.csv.gz](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B6lvkwGmS7a2dW90THBLWVRwTVU)\), we now turn to a [Jupyter notebook](code/book/Example_10_Scrapmetal_Arbitrage_Backtest.ipynb) which shows our analysis of the results.  We start by reading the opportunities file into a simple array:

![Read Collection Opportunities](img/ex10_cell1.PNG)

Next, we need to sort and "clean" opportunities as we've done in the previous example:

![Sort and Clean Opportunities](img/ex10_cell2.PNG)

We know from the previous example that there will be at least one outlier that will likely skew our results.  Skipping ahead to a graph of profit for all opportunities, we see two to three clear outliers:

![Profit for All Opportunities](img/ex10_cell3.PNG)

From inspection, removing opportunities above 250M ISK should be sufficient for our analysis.  After applying this adjustment, we can now consider daily views of profit \(all less outliers\):

![Daily Profit](img/ex10_cell4.PNG)

and return \(profit / cost\):

![Daily Return](img/ex10_cell5.PNG)

Profit is consistently strong until March, while returns remain fairly steady except for a few spikes in February.  The marked change in profit without a change in returns suggests the number of opportunities went down in March.  We can easily test this intuition by plotting opportunity count:

![Daily Opportunity Count](img/ex10_cell6.PNG)

From the graph, it is clear there is a strong drop in opportunities as we enter March.  Why would this be the case?  There are many possible explanations: seasonal effects; market activity moving elsewhere \(e.g. player-owned stations\); improved market efficiency \(unlikely\); etc.  Our back test doesn't cover a large enough time range to reveal a seasonal effect.  Likewise, we would need to perform an analysis of data from player-owned stations to determine whether there is any correlation.  We'll leave these tasks for future work.

The overall strategy seems more profitable than ore and ice.  We can confirm this intuition by considering aggregate measures:

![Daily Aggregates](img/ex10_cell7.PNG)

These numbers are, indeed, better than ore and ice, which is perhaps not surprising given how many opportunities we see.  On the other hand, maximum scrapmetal efficiency is much lower than ore and ice, so the profitability here is somewhat surprising.  The significant difference between average and median is a reflection of the slowdown in March, and the few large days early in the quarter.

Let's turn now to investigating day of week behavior:

![Opportunities (bar) and Profit (line) by Day of Week](img/ex10_cell8.PNG)

These results are quite different than ore and ice in which opportunity and profit peaked on Tuesday.  Scrapmetal arbitrage opportunities are centered around the weekend which is what we would typically expect.  However, Monday has emerged as the peak profit day for this strategy, even though most opportunities occur on Sunday.  If you can only spend one day a week executing your strategy, then these results suggest Monday is the day you should choose.

We can perform a similar analysis of time of day as well:

![Opportunities (bar) and Profit (line) by Hour of Day](img/ex10_cell9.PNG)

As is the case with ore and ice, there is a very clear runup from midnight to a peak at 20:00 (UTC).  Unlike ore and ice, however, the opportunity count peak aligns very closely with the profit peak.  Being ready to strike around 20:00 seems to be very profitable with this strategy.  The other two profitable peaks may coincide with timezone behavior.

Finally, let's look at which asset types are most profitable during the back test.  Our back test discovered opportunities for over 700 distinct asset types, far too many to view all at once.  Instead, we'll focus on the top 50 \(this threshold can easily be changed in the sample notebook\).  Here are the top 50 opportunities by count:

![Opportunities (bar) and Profit (line) Top 50 by Count](img/ex10_cell10.PNG)

Profitability roughly follows opportunity count but it may also be useful to look at top 50 by total profit.  We can create this view by sorting by total profit:

![Opportunities (bar) and Profit (line) Top 50 by Profit](img/ex10_cell11.PNG)

There is no obvious relation between opportunity count and profit shown in this graph.  However, it is useful to highlight which asset types appear in both the top 50 by count as well as the top 50 by profit:

![Opportunities (bar) and Profit (line) Top 50 by Profit - Top 50 by Count (green)](img/ex10_cell12.PNG)

About 40% of the top 50 by count are also in the top 50 by profit.  Since we're most likely to capture a frequently occurring opportunity, this indicates a good chance of also catching a profitable opportunity.

To close out our analysis of arbitrage, let's take a look at the distribution of opportunities and see if there is any useful information that might guide the construction of a trading strategy.  We'll start by constructing the histogram of opportunities by profit up to opportunities worth 10M ISK or less:

![Profit Histogram - 10M ISK or less](img/ex10_cell13.PNG)

This graph doesn't tell us much other than that the majority of opportunities are well less than 200K ISK in value.  Those opportunities might add up to significant value, but it may get tedious to have to consume so many small opportunities.  Let's zoom in on the data for opportunities up to 2M ISK in value.  We can view this data by shrinking the range of opportunity count, and lowering the profit limit:

![Profit Histogram - 2M ISK or less](img/ex10_cell14.PNG)

We see from this zoomed in view that a reasonable number of examples exist up until 1M ISK, after which opportunity counts drop significantly.  How significant is this distribution?  One way to understand significance is to determine the count and profit of opportunites outside of this range:

![Count and Profit above 1M ISK](img/ex10_cell15.PNG)

As expected, the number of opportunities above 1M ISK is very small relative to all opportunities.  However, most of the profit also resides above this line.  This suggests a simple trading strategy where we only take opportunities above 1M ISK, leaving the others for someone else.  How many opportunities might we expect at this threshold?  Is there an even better threshold below 1M ISK?  We can answer these questions by simply iterating over other threshold choices:

![Trading Statistics at Profit Thresholds up to 1M ISK](img/ex10_cell16.PNG)

The data shows a significant drop in daily opportunity count ratio, even at a threshold as low as 100K ISK.  However, the majority of daily profit ratio is still captured.  Thus, while an obvious trading strategy is to simply take every opportunity we find; these results show that this isn't necessary.  In particular, while even dedicated EVE traders may find it tedious to capture 400 \(median\) opportunities a day, they need not bother.  Instead, we can reduce the opportunity count significantly \(by choosing an appropriate threshold\), and still capture a substantial portion of daily profit.

### Analysis Limitations

The results from our analysis above carry a few caveats which are worth listing here.  Despite these limitations, our own real trading at Orbital Enterprises has been very profitable following these strategies.  Nonetheless, it is important to understand what analysis can and can't tell you:

* **Single Region** - our analysis so far has only considered The Forge region.  Although The Forge is the largest high security region by volume, a more complete analysis should include the other four main market regions \(Domain, Sinq Laison, Heimatar and Metropolis\).
* **Memoryless within Snapshots** - we treat each opportunity within a snapshot as completely independent.  In reality, opportunities often produce overlapping refined materials.  As a result, consuming one opportunity may limit the profit and return of other opportunities.  A more correct approach would be to optimize opportunities such that their order of consumption maximizes profit.  This is non-trivial to do.  We've ignored this for simplicity.
* **Memoryless across Snapshots** - just as we are memoryless within a snapshot, we treat each snapshot independently.  That is, we ignore any opportunities that may have been consumed in a previous snapshot.  It would be more correct to track order state across all snapshots as opportunities in later snapshots will be affected by consumed opportunities in earlier snapshots.  Once again, we've ignored this detail for simplicity.
* **Short History** - we've only considered three months of history in our back tests.  This is quite short by most standards although one could argue that at 288 snapshots per day, we've actually analyzed quite a bit of data.  The lack of history impacts the predictive powers of our analysis mainly in the sense that we can't forecast the nature of opportunities we're likely to see in the future.  We've provided some hand-wavy analysis around possible trading behavior \(e.g. data around most profitable days or most profitable times of day\), but a proper analysis might attempt to forecast the appearance of future opportunities \(as well as estimate the error in our predictions, which will be large given the short history\).  Instead of this analysis, we'll argue below that it's safe to simply add this strategy to your portfolio: if opportunities stop appearing, you lose nothing; when opportunities do appear, you'll incur short lived market risk as you consume, refine and sell.

Our basic analysis complete, let's turn now to a discussion of strategy effectiveness.

## Strategy Effectiveness

We've shown in the previous two sections that arbitrage can be profitable over a reasonable time range.  The main advantages of this approach are as follows:

* **Low Risk** - in it's basic form, which is essentialy parking in a station waiting for opportunities, there is very little risk to this strategy.  The primary risk is *market risk* - meaning the chance that market prices will move away from profitability between buying your source asset and selling the refined assets.  Market risk increases over time, but since most arbitrage opportunities are executed very quickly, the exposure is quite low.  You're most likely to see market risk if you wait too long between detecting an opportunity and acting on it \(assuming you don't verify the opportunity again before taking it\).  A secondary risk is *data risk* - meaning the possibility that bad market data indicates an opportunity that doesn't really exist.  Here at Orbital Enterprises we've seen this a number of times, but incidents are relatively easy to detect and avoid \(see [Beware "Ghost" and Canceled Orders](#beware-ghost-and-canceled-orders) below\).
* **Capital Insensitive** - Some might argue that this is a disadvantage, but arbitrage strategies are not influenced by the amount of capital you have to invest.  You'll need sufficient capital to cover buying and refining source material, but adding more ISK to this strategy will not increase your returns.  This is contrary to many other trading strategies in which returns are heavily influenced by the amount of capital invested.
* **Easy To Detect Competition** - Most traders worry about other traders discovering their strategies.  As more traders pile on to the same strategy, the strategy becomes less effective and returns are lower for everyone.  In general, it can be very difficult to determine whether someone else is using your strategy \(they certainly won't tell you\).  With arbitrage, however, everyone sees the same opportunities regardless of how many are trying to act on them.  At best, someone else can beat you to an opportunity.  It is, thus, very easy to determine when you have competition with this strategy.
* **Works Almost Everywhere** - Our data shows that arbitrage opportunities exist even in relatively inefficient NPC stations.  It's true that player-owned stations can refine much more efficiently, but the state of the market at time of writing still allows many profitable opportunities in NPC stations.

The main disadvantages of this approach are as follows:

* **Passive** - arbitrage, as we've described it here, is completely passive.  There will be slow days with few or no opportunities.  You can't do much but wait these out.
* **Skill Intensive** - to get the most value out of this approach, you'll need to train key skills to level five.  This is easier for ice and scrapmetal arbitrage because there are fewer skills.  For ore, however, there are ore-specific refining skills which all must be trained to level five to maximize returns[^12].
* **Compute Intensive** - capturing all available opportunities across the main market centers of EVE is a resource intensive task.  Here at Orbital Enterprises we have one machine dedicated to collecting market data \(somewhat network and compute intensive\), and a second machine dedicated to finding arbitrage opportunities \(definitely compute intensive\).  You can use more modest resources if you're only interested in one region or less frequent checks for opportunities.

In our own experience, this strategy has proven to be very profitable but not without a few mistakes along the way \(see [Practical Trading Tips](#practical-trading-tips)\).  Even with opportunities becoming less frequent in March of 2017, our average run rate is still a comfortable 100M ISK per day.  If nothing else, this is enough to pay for our monthly subscription cost \(via PLEX\).  We've thus kept arbitrage in our current portfolio of strategies.

## Variants

In this section, we consider variants to the basic arbitrage strategy we described above.

### Selling with Limit Orders

The strategies we have described so far have bought source assets and sold refined material at the market \(i.e. at the current best price, instead of using a limit order\).  However, seasoned market professionals would typically use limit orders to sell refined materials in order to maximize profit.  This practice increases risk, since market prices may move away from your fill price, but also increases profit, since your orders will capture the spread \(the difference between the best bid and best ask for an asset\).  Should we be selling refined materials with limit orders instead of simply selling into the current best bid?  Assuming spread prices are favorable, there are at least two reasons why it may be safe to sell with more profitable limit orders:

1. Refined materials from arbitrage are usually highly liquid commodity items; and
2. Highly liquid assets usually incur lower market risk because they are in demand \(i.e. they sell quickly\).

In other words, in liquid markets there should be little risk that our refined materials won't sell in a reasonable time frame.  However, there is one important caveat: we need to avoid flooding the market with atypical volumes of an asset.  As discussed in [Example 6](#example-6---a-simple-strategy-cross-region-trading), a simple rule of thumb is to avoid limit orders which sum to more than 10% of the daily volume of a refined material.

When would we expect limit orders to be more profitable then selling at the market?  To discover these opportunities, we need to adjust our opportunity equation from above to include a new term, $b$, which is the brokerage fee percentage charged for placing a limited order.  With this new term, the opportunity equation becomes:

$\sum_i\left(v_i \times e \times \left[(1 - t - b) \times p_a(c_i) - s_t \times p_r(c_i)\right] \right) -  r_m \times p_a(r)$

There are two changes from the original equation:

1. Brokerage fee, $b$, reduces sale proceeds in the $(1 - t - b)$ term; and,
2. Sale proceeds are now based on the best ask price of the refined material, $p_a(c_i)$, instead of the best bid price.

An opportunity using sell limit orders is profitable if the above equation is greater than zero.  In general, selling with limit orders instead of at the market is more profitable if the following inequality is true:

$(1 - t - b) \times p_a(c_i) > (1 - t) \times p_b(c_i)$

This equation can be reduced to the following inequality:

${{p_a(c_i) - p_b(c_i)}\over{p_b(c_i)}} > {b \over {1 - t - b}}$

The term on the left is the "return on the spread", while the term on the right is constant.  This equation can be evaluated for each refined material to determine whether to sell with limit or market orders.  In the next example, we'll investigate what affect this modified strategy has on arbitrage.  We'll arbitrarily modify our ore and ice arbitrage strategy.  The changes are identical for scrapmetal arbitrage.

### Example 11 - Ore and Ice Arbitrage with Limit Orders

In this example, we'll modify our ore and ice arbitrage strategy to sell refined material with limit orders when it is more profitable do this.  This is a minor change to the original strategy.  We'll evaluate the modified strategy on a sample day of data.  We leave it to the reader to perform a more comprehensive back test.  You can follow along with this example by downloading the [Jupyter Notebook](code/book/Example_11_Ore_and_Ice_Arbitrage_with_Limit_Orders.ipynb).

We'll use the same setup as for [Example 7](example-7---detecting-ore-and-ice-arbitrage-opportunities), where we loaded data for a target date in The Forge trading out of the station Jita IV - Moon 4 - Caldari Navy Assembly Plant.  If you've executed the notebook in Example 7, then you should already have the required market data.  If not, you may consider going back to Example 7 for a moment and executing the cell which downloads market data.  A key part of using limit orders is controlling volume so that we don't flood the market with orders which are unlikely to fill.  We propose basing these limits on a fraction of daily volume for each type.  Volume data is available from market summary data.  Thus, we use the following cell to load this data for our types of interest:

![Load Market History](img/ex11_cell1.PNG)

We're cheating a bit in the sense that a live trading strategy wouldn't have summary information available for the current day.  In that case, summary information can be sampled from prior history \(e.g. weighted average of the previous week of summary data\).  We need to introduce two new constants for limit orders as well:

1. *broker_rate* - this is the percentage fee charged for placing a limit order; and,
2. *volume_limit* - this is the fraction of daily volume which can not be exceeded by sell orders for a particular type, and for a particular opportunity.

We set these, and other constants in the next cell:

![Constants](img/ex11_cell2.PNG)

We ended Example 7 by adding code which maximized profit from each opportunity we found.  That's where we'll start for this example.  Therefore, we include the same functions for buying from or selling two orders in the order book, including related helper functions.  The first new function we need to add is a function which computes the "spread return".  As we described above, an limit order opportunity is indicated when this return value is greater than a constant based on tax rate and broker fee.  The following function computes spread return information for a given type:

![Spread Return Computation](img/ex11_cell3.PNG)

This function works by finding the best bid and ask, then computing the return as described above.  It is possible then either the best bid or best ask does not exist \(e.g. due to lack of orders in the book\).  When this happens, no spread return is computed and all orders for this material will be market orders.

We're now ready to modify our opportunity finder.  We start by modifying the `attempt_opportunity` function as follows:

* We compute a total volume limit for each refined material based on a fraction of the historic volume for this type.  The sum of all limit orders for a refined material can not exceed the volume limit.
* When selling a refined material, we use spread return to decide whether to place limit or market orders.  For limit orders, the price of the order is based on the best ask price in the order book, volume gated by the volume limit.  Market orders are unchanged.
* If an order is a limit order, then we include the broker fee when computing gross proceeds from a cell.

Our `find_opportunities` function is unmodified except that we pass new arguments for broker fee, market summary and volume limit.  With these changes in place, we're now ready to look for opportunities on our sample date.

Maximizing opportunities, along with the limit order modification, takes a significant amount of time.  It takes about an hour on our equipment to execute the next cell:

![Executing Opportunity Finder](img/ex11_cell4.PNG)

Once this cell completes, we can have a look at the results.  Note that we have modified the results display to include whether limit orders were used in an opportunity:

![Opportunity Results](img/ex11_cell5.PNG)

Every single opportunity used limit orders for some or all refined materials.  We also generated a few more opportunities than before \(43 versus 36\).  Return and profit is also higher in many cases.  Aggregates for our sample day confirm our results are better when using limit orders:

![Summary](img/ex11_cell6.PNG)

Comparable numbers from Example 7 are 47,584,077.92 ISK profit, and a return of 0.63%.  Our results from using limit orders more than doubles profit and more than triples return.  We've made the argument that these results are reasonable because we're dealing with highly liquid refined materials in volumes small enough to sell without difficulty.  However, a more careful analysis would consider market variance and try to predict how long it will take to fill all limit orders.  Despite our liquidity argument, it is still likely that one or more orders will need to be re-priced down in order to deal with the usual competition that occurs in the market.

In our own trading here at Orbital Enterprises, we've been satisfied with our results without resorting to limit orders.  Nonetheless, the strategy seems sound.  After conducting a proper back test, you may consider enabling this variant for your own trading.

### Capture "Dumping" with Buy Orders



* take advantage of "dumping" by players needing cash fast
* takes advantage of sale prices below fair market value
* minor change to math to include limit order pricing
* need to do trade analysis to find good liquid dumping targets
  * volume weighted average closer to low price is a good sign?
  * check data to verify

### Cross-Region Reprocessing Arbitrage

* buy in one market, then transport and reprocess in another market
* incurs both market and transport risk (covered in later chapter)

## Practical Trading Tips

### A Sample Trading Strategy

### Keep Up with Static Data Export Changes

### Beware "Ghost" and Canceled Orders

* Market implementation posts orders before execution
  * dumping shows up as someone willing to sell reproc targets at low price
  * buys show up as someone willing to buy reproc output at a high price
* Market participants sometimes make limit order mistakes which they cancel ASAP
* Occasionally these are captured in order book snapshots
* Causes numerous bogus arb opportunities
* Usually easy to detect as a large number of opportunities suddenly appearing

### Use Multi-buy

* Many opportunities buy out several orders
* 0.01 ISK effects cause order bunching
* Can be bought out efficiently with multi-buy with small effect on profit

## For Further Analysis

* Analyze the expected lifetime of a strategy
* After accumulating history, look for common buyers and sellers and their behavior
* Analyze which types produce the most opportunities.  May be highly region dependent.

[^10]: This is changing with the recently announced ["PLEX split"](https://community.eveonline.com/news/dev-blogs/plex-changes-on-the-way/) which allows PLEX to be moved into and out of a special cross region container \(called the "PLEX Vault"\) shared by all characters on a given account.  With this container, you could buy PLEX in one region with one character, move the PLEX to the vault, switch to a character in a different region \(on the same account\), then pull the PLEX from the vault and sell it.  This would allow cross-region arbitrage on PLEX prices without hauling.
[^11]: At time of writing, this page is slightly out of date.  In current game mechanics, the station owner tax is charged as an ISK amount based on refining yield, station tax and reference price, *not* as an adjustment to yield as shown on the EVE University page.
[^12]: Of course, a more careful analysis of opportunities may show it's not worth training certain ore-specific skills to level five due to lack of opportunities.  We leave this analysis as an exercise for the reader.
