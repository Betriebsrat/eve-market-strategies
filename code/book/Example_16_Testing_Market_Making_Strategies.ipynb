    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll create and test a simple market making strategy using the market making targets we discovered in Example 14.  There are three basic steps we need to perform to test a strategy:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Prepare market data samples for the strategy.\n",
    "2. Write the strategy.  See the text for details on how strategies are written.\n",
    "3. Initialize and run the simulator with our prepared market data and our strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll work through these steps below, spending more time towards the end analyzing the output of our simulations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** our simulator uses the simpy package (https://simpy.readthedocs.io/) to implement discrete event simulation.  You'll need to import this package into your environment in order for the simulator to work correctly."

It's interesting to note that in an entire day of trading, our strategy only traded a volume of 100 units \\(50 bought, and 50 sold\\), excluding the last buy and open sell.

A better choice is to base the size according to the typical trade volume seen at our target station.  For a typical active asset, we might be able to capture 10% of the total volume for ourselves.  As we'll plan to make multiple market making round trips, that's still too large for a single order.  We might therefore plan to take 10% of that value as well, allowing us to make around 10 market making round trips in a typical trading session.  In other words, we might estimate a reasonable unit size to be 1% of total volume for a target asset.\n",

    "Once again, we see a wide range of results with a high standard deviation.  Nonetheless, many players would be happy to obtain the average result in each market making session.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results we've shown so far represent an entire day of trading.  Most players, however, will not spend an entire day managing orders and making markets.  Therefore, we may wish to constrain our strategy so that trading only occurs during a subset of the day.  Results from a \"time block\" of trading are more likely to represent our actual results.  A second, slightly more technical, issue is that we've always started our strategy at the beginning of simulated time.  Although the simulator \"warms up\" the book by pre-populating orders, it does not simulate any trades until the simulation actually starts.  To make the simulation more realistic, we should allow the simulator to run for a \\(simulated\\) hour or so in order to give the book a chance to move to a more realistic state.  We consider both of these issues as we finish our analysis of market making simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To allow for a delayed start, and to simulate a block of trading, we'll implement an extension of our existing trading strategy which sleeps until a designated start time, and trades until a dedicated stop time.  We'll arbitrarily choose to trade a four hour block starting one hour after the start of the simulation.  Note that our simulation has no concept of time of day, so we can start our strategy any time we like after the warmup period has passed.  A more realistic simulation would incorporate time of day into the random order and trade generator model.  We leave that topic for future work."

Another variant, which we discussed above, is to leave any open sell orders open for the remainder of the day.
